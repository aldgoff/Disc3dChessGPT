Before I begin deep analysis and indexing, could you confirm your preferred initial focus? For example:

Character Bible – arcs, motivations, and relationships.

Thematic Atlas – mapping philosophical and scientific motifs across episodes.

Continuity Audit – checking for internal consistency, world rules, or scientific logic.

Structural Overview – evolution of plot, tone, and conceptual framework (Boxes → QTP).

Comparative Summary – how later dialogues recontextualize earlier parables.

Once you choose, I’ll start building the Book Bible with that emphasis and generate a searchable reference architecture for the whole series.
