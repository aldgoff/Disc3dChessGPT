Here’s a versioning workflow that works well with OpenAI’s builder setup (which doesn’t yet have built-in version management):

🗂️ 1. Keep a Local “Master” Copy

Maintain a folder on your own system or in a shared drive:

BookBible/
 ├─ 01_instructions_v1.0.txt
 ├─ 02_short_description.txt
 ├─ 03_prompt_starters.txt
 ├─ 04_welcome_message.txt
 └─ CHANGELOG.md


Each file mirrors a field from the builder.
That local copy is your source of truth, not whatever’s currently saved in OpenAI’s UI.

🧾 2. Use a CHANGELOG

Each time you tweak behavior or wording, log it like software releases:

## v1.1 (2025-10-08)
- Added runtime ingestion clarification for multi-book analysis
- Updated welcome message tone


It’s simple but lets you know exactly which version is live.

🧩 3. Update Safely

When you want to change something:

Copy the current builder fields back into your local files (so you have a backup).

Make edits there.

Replace the corresponding fields in the builder.

Click Save and test in preview.

Only then click Publish → this becomes your new version.

That way, no edit overwrites anything you can’t restore.

🔖 4. Tag Versions in the GPT Name (Optional)

If you plan multiple variants or public testing, use semantic tags:

BookBible v1.0 — public release

BookBible v1.1 beta — private test version

You can duplicate GPTs in the builder to preserve older releases.

📦 5. Testing Before Publishing

Always open the GPT in a new chat after each Save and:

Upload a short test manuscript.

Ask three to five representative queries.

Make sure behavior matches the changelog notes.

🔁 6. Rollback Plan

If a change introduces problems:

Open your local previous version’s instructions_vX.txt.

Paste it back into the builder.

Save and republish — instant rollback.

🔒 7. Periodic Archive

Every few months, zip your entire BookBible/ folder and store it in a cloud backup or private repo.
That guarantees long-term recoverability even if OpenAI changes the builder again.

This workflow gives you stable, iterative control without losing anything to the builder’s overwriting behavior.
