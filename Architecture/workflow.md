Workflow:
  Looks like we have slightly different definitions of the roles, so maybe I'm missing something.
  The builder chat stays open in builder mode most of the time - easy to upload the growing spec files to it.
  The apprentice chat helps to develop both the spec files and the regressions, both chats can be used to run regressions, 
    but the apprentice chat can also have book chapters uploaded (to the chat not the builder), so it can help to create accurate specs. 
  If they produce different answers then some part of the manuscript chapter is influencing the apprentice but has not made it into the spec files. 
  The mentor chat reviews builder instructions, spec files, responses, and performs other consistency checks, 
    but the mentor is not reset at this time, the spec files have to be uploaded to it in the chat so they can influence its 'wisdom'. 
  From time to time the builder is "published" (updated) this actually locks down the changes. 
  A new apprentice chat inherits this reset, forgetting whatever manuscript files had been previously uploaded, ready for new ones. 
  It can now move on to the next set of specs (the next chapter) keeping its speed. 
  The apprentice is one tree after another, the mentor is the forest, and the builder is the growing road that captures the essence
  of each tree as it tries to eventually cover the whole forest in a token light way. 
  Clear? Solid?
