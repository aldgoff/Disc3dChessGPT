    "description": "In 2D (a), a straight-line rook move cuts the board, so a rook and a king (White) can checkmate a lone king (Black) – the most basic endgame scenario. In 3D (b), a straight-line rook move does not cut the board and so the mate algorithm fails – doesn’t feel like chess. What kind of a move would cut the board?"
