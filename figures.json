    "description": "In 2D (a), a straight-line rook move cuts the board, so a rook and a king (White) can checkmate a lone king (Black) – the most basic endgame scenario. In 3D (b), a straight-line rook move does not cut the board and so the mate algorithm fails – doesn’t feel like chess. What kind of a move would cut the board?"

    "description": "The orthogonal lines of the 2D rook move cut the 2D board into four disjoint areas (a). The orthogonal planes of the 3D rook move cut the 3D board into eight disjoint volumes (b). The single rook mate algorithm is now dimension agnostic. Planes intersect at the straight-line moves (black diamond inserts). A projection of the 3D rook move onto a face of the board is the 2D rook move."

    "description": "If a ray pair defines a plane, then a planar move might be regarded as two straight-line moves at once; first down one ray, then down the other. However, symmetry implies both traversal orders must be allowed. That means an attack occurs along two paths; the rook attacks both down the 3x6 path and down the 6x3 path. Black cannot defend in a single move. Blocking busted; there go the gambits, there goes the midgame – doesn’t feel like chess."

For clarity only one dual path is highlighted. Similar diagrams would apply for both vertical planes (not shown). The ghost rooks show the moves legal under the dual path rule. "

None are straight-line moves, so the other two planes also support 13 targets. For clarity, only 3 rectangular advancement manifolds are shown (horizontal plane); ghost rooks are segregated for better visibility (a) – (c)."

Each perimeter is two tiles larger than the previous one (3, 5, 7, 9, 11). The line of red diamonds with black inserts represent the two rays (the inner edges of the advancement square). The presence of the knight on the perimeter (outer edges of the advancement square) prevents the rook from moving to those tiles (or beyond); its only legal move on that perimeter is to capture the knight. All the diamonds are slightly smaller than a tile so the underlying tile’s color (black or white) can peek through."

Each type of adjacent cell is connected by a ray of a different type, which can be ordered by the number of coordinates it changes. The unit cell of 2D is the square (a), it has two nearest neighbors; 4 connected by sides (rook), and 4 connected by corners (bishop). Two types of rays connect squares; side rays which change 1 coordinate, and corner rays which change 2 coordinates (a).  The unit cell in 3D is the cube (b), it has 26 nearest neighbors; 6 connected by faces (rook), 12 connected by edges (bishop), and 8 connected by vertices (duke). Three types of rays connect cubes; face rays which change 1 coordinate, edge rays which change 2 coordinates, and vertex rays which change 3 coordinates. Red, green, and blue form the basis of a consistent color scheme."

The White king-side rook starts on a white tile. In 2D, they align along opposing sides (a), in 3D, they align along opposing vertical columns (b). Stack starts next to the royal pieces (bishop level). King is above the queen, so both queens start on white tiles. Pawns are on tile 2,2 (left, right; from each player’s perspective) and promote only on the opponent’s home column (8,8). The piece trays lie outside the board, serving to ID each level. On each level a thin border surrounds the center 4x4 grid of tiles; easier to visualize multi-level moves."
