> "An unspeakable horror seized me. There was a darkness; then a dizzy,
> sickening sensation of sight that was not like seeing; I saw a Line
> that was no Line; Space that was not Space: I was myself, and not
> myself. When I could find voice, I shrieked aloud in agony, 'Either
> this is madness, or it is Hell.' 'It is neither,' calmly replied the
> voice of the Sphere, 'it is Knowledge; it is *Three Dimensions*: open
> your eye once again and try to look steadily.'"

# Acknowledgments

It is a bit of a clichÃ© to thank one's parents, but in a twist of
serendipity they thought it wise one weekend to purchase for their
teenage son a three-level chess board. It kept my interest most of the
afternoon.

It was terribly obvious that the board should be 8x8x8, not 8x8x3, but
what stuck with me was the nagging suspicion that straight-line moves
could not be made to work, symmetric board or not. The board had been
promoted by a dimension, should not the moves also be promoted by a
dimension? What would a "planar" move look like?

Early my first year at Oregon State University, I encountered two
mathematicians (Tim and Rob), who broached the subject of 3D chess.
After a brief tussle of intellectual gymnastics, they too became
convinced that straight-line moves were a dead end, and returning the
next day from classes, I opened the door to my small dorm room to find a
hanging 3D chess board made from string and carboard (scavenged from
pizza cartons, used I am persuaded), each of 8 levels covered with
wrapping paper sporting a 2D chess pattern, brilliantly of just the
right size.

Over the course of the year, several variations of the idea of planar
moves were explored, but no consensus was reached. I have since lost
contact with Tim and Rob, but as things worked out, I ended up with the
prototype board and an enticing but incomplete set of rules. Wherever
you two are, thanks for the great launch; our discussions convinced me
this was a problem worth tackling.

Over the years I sporadically continued the search for a set of rules
that really *felt like chess* and many thanks go to Dale Lehmann, my
best friend, who endured countless long evenings of exploration. He
forced me to articulate what I thought I saw, never permitted us the
luxury of sloppy thinking, nor tolerated the laziness of shortcuts. The
first result of our collaboration was the award of a patent for a
preliminary ruleset in 1991 that introduced planar moves and advancement
squares. In the ensuing years, his rigor allowed us to uncover
additional hidden assumptions and truly discover a rule set as free from
invention as possible.

Likewise, Dr. Joel Siegel, a retired mathematician and gifted teacher,
endured countless sessions of brainstorming, frustrating obstacles,
obscure alternatives, and occasional breakthroughs. His keen insight
into fundamentals were a steady source of encouragement and course
corrections. His passion for pedagogy infuses this work.

Both Dale and Joel share a love of epiphanies; and one of my guilty
pleasures was anticipating the light bulb going off in their minds,
waiting for the 'aha' moment to strike their faces when they 'got it.'
Their delight kept me energized to see this through to the end.

I must also thank my writing group for their professionalism and
generous sharing of the tips and tricks of the trade. This work would be
far less readable without their assistance. A special thanks goes out to
the leader of our group, Donna Cowan, who as the scope of the project
increased provided both encouragement and the technical expertise to
push it over the finish line.

And then there are the reviewers; the countless souls who accepted the
mission request to read this tome from stem to stern; 500 pages is a Big
Ask. Thanks to them, many silly errors and more than a few blunders were
found prior to publication. I am in their debt. Notable contributors
include John Levine, Lance Marcum, Charles Phares, Curt Aikin, Luke
Santostefano, and Dr. Dudley Goff; thanks for the 8x8x3 board, dad.

I am also indebted to Martin Nivinski who dared me to *convince* him
that we had truly found the *one right rule set*. Not one to shy away
from a challenge, he then wrote the core code for a Unity based game
engine which can form the foundation for a game proper and perhaps in
the future a 3D chess puzzle builder. His careful analysis, software
engineering discipline, and critical reasoning resulted in a game engine
which allowed for fast and accurate analyses. Without his efforts, there
would undoubtedly be far more errors in this work than there (ahem) are.

I am also blessed with loyal family members (wife Jamie, and daughters
Leslie and Maggie) who provided both proofreading and advice, (although
in hindsight, none ever actually *played* a game against me, go figure).

The flimsy construction of the original 3D board (that suspended
contraption of string and gift-wrapped cardboard levels, now well hidden
in my den) formed an irritating wave machine. The slightest bump would
send it into a variety of oscillation modes, knocking pieces over and
sometimes completely off the board. Probably should have shelved it
somewhere in the prop room of the physics department.

I eventually retired it, replacing it with something more stable
(engineering) and in my opinion something more aesthetic (art). So, one
more callout to my wife, who has graciously tolerated a behemoth
5-foot-tall multi-level plexiglass chess board in our home for many,
many years.[^1]

# Preface

## Motivation

The premise of this work is that the rules for playing chess in three
dimensions should be discovered, not invented. The discovery[]{.indexref
entry="discovery:Rules to 3D chess must be discovered, not invented."}
criterion is simple, 'does it []{#feel_like_chess .anchor}*feel like
chess*[]{.indexref
entry="feel like chess:Play in 3D must feel like chess, a one pawn advantage wins."}?'
Coming up with rules to move chess-like pieces around a
three-dimensional board is a process of []{#invention
.anchor}*invention*[]{.indexref
entry="invention:Simple primitives chosen to lead to complex play."};
constraining them to yield chess-like behavior is a process of
*discovery*[]{.indexref
entry="discovery:Rules to 3D chess must be discovered, not invented."}.

This change in approach is driven by two observations. First, the
invention strategy has not paid off; in most rule sets for playing chess
in three dimensions, a one pawn advantage is no longer sufficient to win
the game, and therefore requires an unreasonable material advantage to
force mate. Not only does this not feel like chess, but it also has the
bitter result that games between players of equal skill almost always
end in a draw.

The second observation is that the discipline of discovery typically
reveals just how pervasively hidden assumptions infect our thinking.
Identifying and questioning hidden assumptions is a fundamental aspect
of lateral thinking.[^2] The strongest hidden assumptions, the ones most
deeply buried, lie behind paradigms. A deeply entrenched paradigm blocks
the path to 3D chess, and this one paradigm has singlehandedly made it
seem that play in three dimensions, play that truly 'feels like chess,'
is an impossibility. Because of these considerations, an ambitious goal
was embraced; a quest really, to find the []{#one_right_rule_set
.anchor}*one right rule set* for 3D chess. This is an audacious
objective and following it through to completion requires a significant
intellectual investment.

There are delightful surprises along the way, indeed a most unexpected
one; portents of quantum principles show up all on their own, uninvited.
This raises the question, "Just how fundamental are quantum principles,
and have we overlooked them in unusual places?"

Thus, three themes weave this book together: discovery, paradigms, and
the quantum realm.

## Criteria for Success

The rules for most games are invented, carefully chosen to lead to
interesting play; Chess, Go, Pandemic, whatever. For chess in three
dimensions, however, the challenge is different; is there a rule set
that still feels like chess[]{.indexref
entry="feels like chess:Play in 3D must feel like chess, a one pawn advantage wins."}?
Is it even possible?

Five criteria will be our guide.

1.  []{#endgame .anchor}*Endgames* must work out the same, else a one
    pawn advantage won't win the game.

2.  The []{#midgame .anchor}*midgame*[]{.indexref
    entry="midgame:The middle part of the game where gambits rule."}
    must exhibit a similar give and take; forks, pins, discovers,
    attack, defense, blocking, capture, exchanges, sacrifices, etc.

3.  []{#opening .anchor}*Openings* must still stress initiative, control
    of the center, position & mobility, an effective pawn
    wall[]{.indexref
    entry="pawn wall:Cooperating interconnected set of pawns which hamper development."},
    etc.

4.  The rules should be expressible in a []{#dimension_agnostic
    .anchor}*dimension agnostic*[]{.indexref
    entry="dimension agnostic:Rules of chess which scale to higher dimensions as invariants."}
    form; so called []{#congruent_rules .anchor}*congruent rules* that
    would reasonably extend to 4D chess, or even higher.[^3]

5.  Projection of the 3D move onto a two-dimensional surface should
    yield the 2D move.

These are our discovery criteria;[]{.indexref
entry="discovery:Rules to 3D chess must be discovered, not invented."}
constraints to protect us from the temptation of invention.

As with any quest there is no guarantee of success -- but there is a
chance.

The principal insight is that pieces in 3D should move in
[]{#flat_planes .anchor}*flat planes*,[]{.indexref
entry="flat planes,:Orthogonal (rook), skew (bishop), slant (duke)."}
rather than along []{#straight_lines .anchor}*straight lines*; the
*board* has been promoted by a dimension -- so should the *moves*.
Immediately the endgames work out the same. This discovery[]{.indexref
entry="discovery:Rules to 3D chess must be discovered, not invented."}
makes an excellent example of a paradigm shift, a practical example of
"thinking out of the box."

The justification for this pedantic perspective is that deeply
entrenched and intransigent paradigm barrier; it hides the correct
solution. An entirely new type of move, one not seen in any other board
game, is required: the []{#planar_move .anchor}*planar move*[]{.indexref
entry="planar move:A move without a trajectory in a plane which cuts a 3D board."}.
Alas, []{#straight_line_move .anchor}*straight-line moves* cannot be
made to work.

It is the planar move[]{.indexref
entry="planar move:A move without a trajectory in a plane which cuts a 3D board."},
the idea that a piece may advance to any location in its type of plane,
*without a unique trajectory*[]{.indexref
entry="trajectory:A unique path (a sequence of tiles) from one tile to another."},
that distinguishes this rule set from other 3D chess variants. No other
game has this type of move; it is new, radically so. It is a paradigm
shift in the full Kuhnian sense.[^4] Without this paradigm shift, chess
cannot be elevated to three dimensions and still retain its essential
nature. To reiterate, the board has been []{#promoted .anchor}*promoted*
by a dimension, from two to three -- so the moves must also be
*promoted* by a dimension, from one to two. 'Chess-ness' comes from the
difference in these dimensions being *frozen at exactly one*. This is
the most fundamental invariant[]{.indexref
entry="invariant:A pattern which remains constant while other things change."}
in []{#congruent_chess .anchor}*congruent chess*[]{.indexref
entry="congruent chess:An expression of the rules of chess which work in any dimension."}
(chess in any dimension), chess pieces move in a space *one dimension
less* than the board. Once this shift is made, the rest follows
naturally, largely inevitably.

The planar move[]{.indexref
entry="planar move:A move without a trajectory in a plane which cuts a 3D board."}
violates deeply held convictions about what a move is; even what motion
is, as a physical concept. It raises a material question, "is motion
essentially classical, or is it ultimately quantum?"

## Structure

To these ends, Part I presents the rules as a *discovery*[]{.indexref
entry="discovery:Rules to 3D chess must be discovered, not invented."}
*process*, using insight and rigor to evaluate and reject alternatives
that fail the discovery[]{.indexref
entry="discovery:Rules to 3D chess must be discovered, not invented."}
test. Overcoming the obstacles to 3D chess requires a careful assessment
of which degenerate invariants[^5] in 2D chess are more fundamental.
This section penetrates the paradigm barrier. Step by step the
discovery[]{.indexref
entry="discovery:Rules to 3D chess must be discovered, not invented."}
path leads to a foundation for establishing a unique rule set, a
logically coherent set, one that just feels right, replete with
unexpected but confirming "aha" moments.

Part II focuses on how each *individual piece moves*. How do planar
moves differ between the base pieces, and how do they combine to define
the moves of the other pieces. Each piece is given its own chapter, as
are en passant and castling.

Part III focuses on how the new rules impact[]{.indexref
entry="impact:Measures of a pieceâs ability to affect the game; range, PPR, & stab."}
the *fundamental interactions between pieces*. The ways in which pieces
can interact is not only richer in 3D chess, but also more complete. The
symmetries between how pieces interact is broken in 2D -- in some sense
there is insufficient resolution -- but in 3D they are restored to their
full glory.

Part IV covers the *tactics and strategies* of 3D chess. Every behavior
one finds in 2D chess is present but nestled in between them are new
behaviors beyond the reach of both classical chess and other 3D chess
variants. Surprises abound, revealing a virgin territory of new gambits
just begging to be explored.

Part V explores the *quantum paradigm*. The planar move, advancement
square and subsequent loss of trajectories lead directly to more than a
dozen analogs with quantum physics. A review of the degenerate
invariants that led to the planar move breakthrough forms a natural
segue into the final chapter -- a quantum version of chess in three
dimensions.[^6]

The book concludes with an Epilog, various Appendices and tables, and
the traditional reference material. The index offers some meta-insight
into the work -- the number of referenced pages per entry is a rough
metric of the importance of that concept.

## Kindle Expectations

The Kindle platform has come a long way since its pioneering inception
and Amazon continues to improve it. It is particularly well suited for
the figures in this book, as one can zoom in on them: something not
possible with print. However, this is a large book, about a complicated
subject, and it was written in Microsoft WordÂ® using many of Word's
advanced features; a few of which challenge Kindle's conversion
algorithms. The technical gurus at Kindle have been easy to work with
and responsive, but it takes time to improve software, so I've chosen to
go to market even though a few glitches remain.

Nobody's eBooks yet support footnotes, but Kindle at least collects them
at the end of the book just before the endnotes. The links can be flaky,
but when they work, you can tap to go to them and tap to return to the
text. Hypertext links are also used in some of the tables, but since
forward and return tapping can be sporadic, your mileage may vary.
Finally, equations may be rendered a little wonky, but there are few and
only in the quantum chapters.

The only major glitch was that Kindle has a limit on the size of tables.
Thus, the very large Jargon table (Table 23, with more than 300 entries)
was broken into three sub tables.

The preferred device type is tablet or larger, however all text and
figures render just fine on a smart phone. The few lists of chess moves
will wrap on a phone which makes them harder to read, and some tables
will wrap some text in small cells.

Obviously, the TOC and index page numbers refer only to the print
version, but the hypertext links in the TOC work flawlessly and form a
truly convenient navigation tool. The hypertext links in the List of
Figures and the Table of Tables are also flawless and likewise offer
convenience not achievable with print.

# Part I -- Foundations

All variants of chess, in particular the 3D variants, have one thing in
common; they show respect for the invariants of 2D chess. However, in
the excursion to three dimensions, some of these invariants display a
duality, they split into incompatible patterns; one must be chosen at
the expense of another. Such invariant pairs are referred to as
[]{#degenerate_rules .anchor}*degenerate rules*[]{.indexref
entry="degenerate rules:Equivalent in a lower abstraction but different in a higher abstraction."}:
different ways of specifying a single rule that have exactly the same
consequences in one realm but divergent consequences in a higher
abstraction. Which invariants are *honored*, and which *shunned*, pretty
much determine the rules.

In most attacks on the problem of playing chess in three dimensions, the
canonical invariant is that pieces which advance move in *straight
lines*. In the approach advocated here, the canonical invariant is that
pieces which advance move in *one dimension less* than the board.

In 2D this means that pieces advance, coincidently, in straight lines
(2 - 1 = 1). The two rules, "advance in a straight line" and "advance in
a space one dimension less than the board" are degenerate in 2D. This
degeneracy is broken in 3D.

In 3D, advancing in a space one dimension less than the board means
pieces advance in flat planes (3 - 1 = 2). These two different ways of
expressing the "advance" rule scale to higher dimensions in very
different ways, with huge consequences.

Planar moves are the initial breakthrough that yields hope there is in
fact *one right rule set* that leads to play that genuinely *feels like
chess*. They are the basis for how pieces *should* move.

The objective of Part I is to discover[]{.indexref
entry="discover:A piece which when moved unblocks an attack from another piece."}
the correct *size and shape* of the board, the right *set of pieces*,
and the particular *planes* each piece should move in.

## The Trajectory Paradigm

While the moves for each piece will be presented individually in Part
II, they share a common heritage which is best illuminated by
considering the rook. A robust paradigm barrier separates chess in two
dimensions from chess in higher dimensions. A mathematical approach to
discovering the rules to 3D chess would encounter this paradigm somewhat
later in the development. However, there is some tedium involved in that
path, so instead we'll head to high ground for a preliminary view of the
promised land. The intent is to convince the reader that something new
and exciting has been discovered, something unique that sets this rule
set apart from others, a paradigm breakthrough. The breakthrough is what
validates the claim of *one right rule set*[]{.indexref
entry="one right rule set:The thesis that there is just one right rule set for 3D chess."},
and justifies the intellectual investment required to follow a formal
line of development.

Of necessity, this means that some initial, plausible choices about the
fundamentals of 3D chess, such as board size and shape, will be
temporarily assumed without justification. For instance, the 3D board
shall be regarded as a cube of cubes, and the dimension
agnostic[]{.indexref
entry="dimension agnostic:Rules of chess which scale to higher dimensions as invariants."}
term []{#tile .anchor}*tile*[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
will be used to refer to either square or cube, trusting in context to
disambiguate. Even the piece designs will have a justification. Said
justifications will be more rigorously developed in Part II as the
design of each piece derives from the explicit rule for how it moves. It
is a long-standing chess tradition that the design of each piece alludes
to how it moves; one more pillar in the challenge of finding a rule set
that *feels like chess*.

In due course, a formal color-coding scheme will be introduced. For now,
just know that red will indicate 'rook'. In this section, good ideas --
to shortly be rejected because they do not lead to chess-like play --
will be shown in black; only ultimately correct solutions will be in
color.[^7]

The rook will be our guide, our paradigm trail blazer. We join our hero
in his finest moment, the endgame.

### Obstacle #1 -- Demise of the Endgame[]{.indexref entry="Endgame:Simple scenarios near the end of the game where mate is achieved."}

Figure 1 shows the classic endgame of a single rook and king against a
lone king. In 2D, the rook's move cuts the board into 4 disjoint regions
(a). The opposing king will find itself trapped in one of them. The
White king and rook work together to shrink the *area* of the region
confining the Black king until mate is achieved.

However, in 3D, even with access to the full vertical extent of the
board, a rook's straight-line move[]{.indexref
entry="straight-line move:A move in a straight line which cuts a 2D board."}
fails to cut the 3D board into disjoint regions and the opposing king is
free to move to any tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
not directly under attack (b). Mate is not possible with a single rook,
nor with both rooks, nor even with three (which is more than either
player even starts with).

This is not the only endgame to crumble under the weight of three
dimensions; most of them no longer work at all, with the catastrophic
result that games are unwinnable without a vast material advantage.
Games between players of equal skill therefore end in stalemate; boring
-- and again, not like chess.

![[]{#_Ref59297720 .anchor}Figure 1: Single Rook Mate
Endgame[]{.indexref
entry="Endgame:Simple scenarios near the end of the game where mate is achieved."}
Cannot be Done with Straight-line
Moves](media/image2.png){alt="A picture containing shape Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="7.5256944444444445in"}

In 2D (a), a straight-line rook move cuts the board, so a rook and a
king (White) can checkmate a lone king (Black) -- the most basic endgame
scenario. In 3D (b), a straight-line rook move does *not* cut the board
and so the mate algorithm fails -- doesn't feel like chess[]{.indexref
entry="feel like chess:Play in 3D must feel like chess, a one pawn advantage wins."}.
What kind of a move would cut the board?

What kind of a move would cut the board into disjoint regions, regions
that would confine the lone king, regions that could be shrunk to zero,
allowing a successful mate of the opposing king? To ask the question is
to very nearly answer it, but let's sneak up on it anyway. In 2D, the
major pieces that advance (all but the knight) do so along rays
(directed line segments of unit length), that change either one
coordinate or two. The rook advances along a ray[]{.indexref
entry="ray:A directed line segment of unit length that connects adjacent tiles."}
that changes only *one* coordinate; thus, it moves through the sides
that connect adjacent squares. The bishop advances along a
ray[]{.indexref
entry="ray:A directed line segment of unit length that connects adjacent tiles."}
that changes *two* coordinates; thus, it moves through the corners that
connect adjacent squares. Call the first a []{#side_ray .anchor}*side
ray*[]{.indexref
entry="side ray:Unit length ray that points to adjacent square through a side."},
and the second a []{#corner_ray .anchor}*corner ray*[]{.indexref
entry="corner ray:Unit length ray that points to adjacent square through a corner."}.
The queen may advance along either a side ray[]{.indexref
entry="side ray:Unit length ray that points to adjacent square through a side."}
or a corner ray[]{.indexref
entry="corner ray:Unit length ray that points to adjacent square through a corner."}.

Because a side ray[]{.indexref
entry="side ray:Unit length ray that points to adjacent square through a side."}
changes only one coordinate, the rook can reach *every* square on the
board, but because the corner ray[]{.indexref
entry="corner ray:Unit length ray that points to adjacent square through a corner."}
changes two coordinates, the bishop can reach only *half* the squares on
the board.

In 2D, pieces move in straight lines, along a *single* ray[]{.indexref
entry="ray:A directed line segment of unit length that connects adjacent tiles."},
and thus they move in a one-dimensional space; one dimension less than
the 2D board. If in 3D, pieces moved in planes (flat surfaces), along
*two* rays, they would be moving in a two-dimensional space: one
dimension less than the 3D board. Call this a *planar move*[]{.indexref
entry="planar move:A move without a trajectory in a plane which cuts a 3D board."}.

In 2D, there are *two* types of rays; *side rays* that connect squares
through their sides and change only *one* coordinate, and *corner rays*
that connect squares through their corners and change all *two*
coordinates. One type of ray for each type of neighbor; side and corner.

In 3D, there are *three* types of rays; *face rays* that connect cubes
through their faces and change only *one* coordinate, *edge
rays*[]{.indexref
entry="edge ray:Unit length ray that points to adjacent cube through an edge."}
that connect cubes through their edges and change *two* coordinates, and
*vertex rays*[]{.indexref entry="âvertex"} that connect cubes through
their vertices and change all *three* coordinates. One type of ray for
each type of neighbor; face, edge, and vertex.

### Planar Moves

Figure 2 shows exactly the same state of the boards as the previous
figure but this time with planar moves on the 3D board rather than
straight-line moves. This changes everything. Instead of the rook moving
in three []{#orthogonal_line .anchor}*orthogonal* *lines* it is now
allowed to move in three []{#orthogonal_plane .anchor}*orthogonal*
*planes*.

These three planes slice the board into disjoint regions (now eight
instead of four). Under this move, the opposing king will find itself
trapped in one of them. The White king and rook can now work together to
shrink the *volume* of the region confining the Black king until mate is
achieved. Indeed, it is exactly the same algorithm as in 2D, just a few
extra moves to confine the king against the extra dimension. See
"Chapter 19: Endgames" for the details.

The previous straight-line moves are indicated with dark inserts in the
red diamonds, they indicate the face rays. Each line (two rays in
opposite directions) is the intersection of two planes. The rook is
moving in a space only *one* dimension less than the board, same as in
2D. In contrast, the straight-line move[]{.indexref
entry="straight-line move:A move in a straight line which cuts a 2D board."}
on a 3D board was moving in a space *two* dimensions less than the board
(previous figure). The planar move[]{.indexref
entry="planar move:A move without a trajectory in a plane which cuts a 3D board."}
is the critical breakthrough that allows play in three dimensions to
feel like chess.

The orthogonal *lines* of the 2D rook move cut the 2D board into *four*
disjoint *areas* (a). The orthogonal *planes* of the 3D rook move cut
the 3D board into *eight* disjoint *volumes* (b). The single rook mate
algorithm is now *dimension agnostic*[]{.indexref
entry="dimension agnostic:Rules of chess which scale to higher dimensions as invariants."}.
Planes intersect at the straight-line moves (black diamond inserts). A
projection of the 3D rook move onto a face of the board is the 2D rook
move.

By now the answer should start to feel inevitable; pieces which moved in
*lines* in 2D, should move in *planes* in 3D. In the case of the rook
this means three *orthogonal* planes; one horizontal, two vertical.

### Obstacle #2 -- Blocking

Given a pair of rays, it is natural to assume that a piece advances
first along one ray[]{.indexref
entry="ray:A directed line segment of unit length that connects adjacent tiles."}
then along the other. Two different rays define a plane. A pair of rays
is the very foundation of the planar move[]{.indexref
entry="planar move:A move without a trajectory in a plane which cuts a 3D board."}.
For instance, one might imagine a rook advancing along one face
ray[]{.indexref
entry="face ray:Unit length ray that points to adjacent cube through a face."}
out N tiles, then advancing M tiles along another face ray[]{.indexref
entry="face ray:Unit length ray that points to adjacent cube through a face."}
at right angles. The rook is advancing along each ray through the faces
connecting adjoining cubes, changing just one coordinate at a time. But
there is an ambiguity because the rays may be followed in either order.
Is the move MxN or is it NxM?

Figure 3 shows the ambiguity. There are two paths; White has a dual
attack on a single piece, and Black cannot block[]{.indexref
entry="block:Blocks cover, prevents a piece from moving to a desired location."}
both in a single move. In 2D, that can't happen, an attack always comes
from *only one direction*. Because of symmetry, both paths must be
allowed; blocking is busted; there go the chess gambits, there goes the
midgame[]{.indexref
entry="midgame:The middle part of the game where gambits rule."}. The
straight-line move[]{.indexref
entry="straight-line move:A move in a straight line which cuts a 2D board."}
didn't feel like chess[]{.indexref
entry="feel like chess:Play in 3D must feel like chess, a one pawn advantage wins."},
and the []{#dual_path_move .anchor}*dual path* *move*[]{.indexref
entry="dual path move:Debunked move first down one ray then the other, or vice-a-versa."}
doesn't either, yet we were led to it inexorably by the requirement to
have the pieces move in planes. Only planar moves can save the endgame.
A pair of rays define a plane, but they also imply dual path attacks
which cannot be blocked in a single move. Our quest, for the 'one right
rule set[]{.indexref
entry="one right rule set:The thesis that there is just one right rule set for 3D chess."}',
requires that both the endgame and the midgame[]{.indexref
entry="midgame:The middle part of the game where gambits rule."} feel
like chess[]{.indexref
entry="feel like chess:Play in 3D must feel like chess, a one pawn advantage wins."}.

![[]{#_Ref59308149 .anchor}Figure 3: Rook's Dual Path Attack on a Knight
--
Rejected](media/image4.png){alt="A screenshot of a video game Description automatically generated with medium confidence"
width="6.5in" height="1.0277777777777777in"}

If a ray[]{.indexref
entry="ray:A directed line segment of unit length that connects adjacent tiles."}
pair defines a plane, then a planar move[]{.indexref
entry="planar move:A move without a trajectory in a plane which cuts a 3D board."}
might be regarded as two straight-line moves at once; first down one
ray[]{.indexref
entry="ray:A directed line segment of unit length that connects adjacent tiles."},
then down the other. However, symmetry implies both traversal orders
must be allowed. That means an attack occurs along *two* paths; the rook
attacks both down the 3x6 path and down the 6x3 path. Black cannot
defend in a single move. Blocking busted; there go the gambits, there
goes the midgame[]{.indexref
entry="midgame:The middle part of the game where gambits rule."} --
doesn't feel like chess[]{.indexref
entry="feel like chess:Play in 3D must feel like chess, a one pawn advantage wins."}.

We are being humbled; the paradigm is fighting back. Perhaps there are
no rule sets that can reproduce the feel of chess in three dimensions.
Perhaps, sigh, chess is exclusively a two-dimensional game. The quest is
blocked, by blocking of all things, how ironic.

We were successful in rising to the challenge of figuring out what kind
of move cut the board (a planar move[]{.indexref
entry="planar move:A move without a trajectory in a plane which cuts a 3D board."}).
Now we face a new question, "What kind of a move can make a planar
attack, but which can be blocked in a single move by the opponent?" How
does a dual path attack get reduced to an attack, "from only one
direction?"

One possibility is to declare that *both* paths must be unblocked for
the piece to be under attack. This allows the attack to be blocked by
placing a third piece on *either* path. While counter-intuitive, it does
at first glance appear to solve the blocking problem.

### STAB (Simultaneous Threat And Barter)

While the rules may require a process of discovery, naming things is a
process of invention. It is useful to introduce the term
*cover*[]{.indexref
entry="cover:Can move to a tile, generic term for attack foe or defend friend."},
to indicate either attacking an opponent's piece or defending one's own
piece. []{#stab .anchor}*STAB*[]{.indexref
entry="Stab:Simultaneous Threat and Barter - count of tiles a piece can cover."}
is the measure of cover. The ideal STAB value is how many pieces any one
piece can cover from the center of an empty board[]{.indexref
entry="cover:Can move to a tile, generic term for attack foe or defend friend."}.
In 2D, that's 4 for the rook and bishop, and 8 for the queen, king, and
knight.

'Simultaneous Threat and Defense' would be more accurate but leads to a
meaningless acronym, 'stad,' while 'Simultaneous Attack and Defend' is
even worse.[^8] If 'barter' is regarded as an exchange, "if you take
mine, I'll take yours," then STAB[]{.indexref
entry="stab:Simultaneous Threat and Barter - count of tiles a piece can cover."}
works out very nicely.

The problem is that the STAB value under the dual path rule is obscenely
high.

Figure 4 shows the problem. The rook can circumvent closer pieces and
attack ones farther away. The 13 ghost rooks show the potential, but for
clarity only one dual path attack is shown; that's 13 pieces per plane.
If the planar move is envisioned as a dual path, even with the blocking
rule[]{.indexref
entry="blocking rule:Pieces on the kingâs apex tiles block the advancement square."}
that obstructing *either* path blocks the attack, such an interpretation
results in an astonishing STAB[]{.indexref
entry="stab:Simultaneous Threat and Barter - count of tiles a piece can cover."}
factor of 39! The rook is able to circumvent closer pieces and reach
ones 'behind' it. A single piece could cover[]{.indexref
entry="cover:Can move to a tile, generic term for attack foe or defend friend."}
all the other pieces on the board -- it won't feel like chess.

![[]{#_Ref63076637 .anchor}Figure 4: Rook's Outrageous STAB of 39 for
Dual Path Move -
Rejected](media/image5.png){alt="A picture containing building Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="1.1944444444444444in"}

A rook allowed to move along dual paths can attack or defend 13 other
pieces in each plane. Shown is one rook near the center of a horizontal
plane[]{.indexref
entry="horizontal plane:Rook plane that is horizontal (a level, constant Z-axis)."}.
For clarity only one dual path is highlighted. Similar diagrams would
apply for both vertical planes (not shown). The ghost rooks show the
moves legal under the dual path rule.

While initially promising, the dual path rule fails to feel like chess.
However, this option does have an upside, it introduces the concept of
nonlocality; the mere existence of something *over there* (on the other
path) determines if a piece's presence *over here* (on this path) is
causal or not. In the jargon of brainstorming it is a transitional
concept; a 'bad' idea that leads to a 'good' idea.

### Nonlocality

We begin by backing up.

How does a piece in 2D really move? Does it advance until it runs into
something? It certainly feels that way when we pick up a physical piece
and move it from one square to another. Although, come to think of it,
we do generally pick -- it -- up, into the third dimension, rather than
sliding it along the surface of the board proper.

Is that the only way of describing a move? Recall that a piece starts in
one tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."},
ends up in another, perhaps many tiles away. It was *here*, now it's
*there*. Was it really, *ever*, anywhere in between? (Look at a listing
of the moves to a 2D chess game; those intervening squares are nowhere
to be found.)

The physical board and pieces are not the game; they are certainly not
the rules. They are only conventionalizations that help our finite minds
enforce the rules. Only the rules are the game. A mathematician would
call the game a *formal system*[]{.indexref
entry="formal system:A perfectly isolated system (mathematical); a mini universe."}.[^9]

In between *here* and *there*, were some small number of tiles. Anything
unique about them? We are talking just about pieces with unlimited
range[]{.indexref
entry="range:What percentage of the board a piece can eventually reach."},
pieces that can be blocked (the knight is another matter). Back to the
in-between tiles; what do they have in common?

They have empty in common.[^10] The set of in-between tiles contain no
pieces, not a single one. The set happens to have, in 2D, the
geometrical form of a line segment. A line segment is in a space *one
dimension less* than a 2D board. A 'plane segment' (whatever that means)
would be in a space *one dimension less* than a 3D board.

2D chess confronts us with a []{#conceptual_degeneracy
.anchor}*conceptual degeneracy*[]{.indexref
entry="conceptual degeneracy:Two descriptions only equivalent at a lower level of abstraction."}:
does a piece advance until it runs into another piece, or does it just
advance until some growing set of tiles (along a single ray[]{.indexref
entry="ray:A directed line segment of unit length that connects adjacent tiles."})
ceases to be empty? In the latter case, call the set of tiles which must
be empty an []{#advancement_manifold .anchor}*advancement
manifold*[]{.indexref
entry="advancement manifold:Regular region of tiles which must be empty to permit move."}.

A first guess at an answer is shown in Figure 5.

![[]{#_Ref59308749 .anchor}Figure 5: The Rectangular Advancement
Manifold (RAM[]{.indexref
entry="RAM:Rectangular Advancement Manifold."}) --
Rejected](media/image6.png){alt="A screenshot of a video game Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="1.0277777777777777in"}

White's rook is attacking the Black knight via a
[]{#rectangular_advancement_manifold .anchor}*rectangular advancement
manifold*[]{.indexref
entry="advancement manifold:Regular region of tiles which must be empty to permit move."}
(*RAM*[]{.indexref entry="RAM:Rectangular Advancement Manifold."} for
short). There can be no other pieces in the 18 tiles that make up this
[]{#RAM .anchor}RAM[]{.indexref
entry="RAM:Rectangular Advancement Manifold."}. Black can
block[]{.indexref
entry="block:Blocks cover, prevents a piece from moving to a desired location."}
this attack with a single move by moving another piece onto *any* of the
16 empty tiles marked in black.

In 2D, the advancement manifold[]{.indexref
entry="advancement manifold:Regular region of tiles which must be empty to permit move."}
is a line segment, in 3D, it is, perhaps, a rectangle, and the MxN
rectangle must be empty of any other pieces for the move to be legal.

Here is a blockable planar attack; gambits restored, midgame[]{.indexref
entry="midgame:The middle part of the game where gambits rule."} saved,
all without sacrificing the endgame. Not too bad, not too bad at all.

So why is Figure 5 in black and white?

### Obstacle #3 -- Openings 

The RAM[]{.indexref entry="RAM:Rectangular Advancement Manifold."} rule
is easy to visualize, it is easy to present and describe, and it is even
easy to program. But this paradigm barrier has another punch to throw.
Does an MxN advancement manifold[]{.indexref
entry="advancement manifold:Regular region of tiles which must be empty to permit move."}
grow by M or by N? In the above example of the growing advancement
manifold[]{.indexref
entry="advancement manifold:Regular region of tiles which must be empty to permit move."},
were tiles added three-at-a-time 6 times, or were tiles added
six-at-a-time 3 times? The ambiguity stinks.

A further smell is that moves with skinny rectangular manifolds will be
harder to block[]{.indexref
entry="block:Blocks cover, prevents a piece from moving to a desired location."}
than moves with fat rectangular manifolds. The fattest rectangular
manifolds will actually be square, so the rule isn't very isotropic
either. But it gets worse.

The worst-case STAB value is still 39.

Figure 6 shows an example, broken into 3 parts for enhanced clarity.

![[]{#_Ref63180594 .anchor}Figure 6: RAM STAB --
Rejected](media/image7.png){alt="A picture containing text, checker Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="3.4305555555555554in"}

Under the RAM rule, the rook STAB value is still 39. Ghost rooks show
the 13 locations that can be simultaneously covered by the rook under
the RAM rule in one plane. None are straight-line moves, so the other
two planes also support 13 targets. For clarity, only 3 rectangular
advancement manifolds are shown (horizontal plane); ghost rooks are
segregated for better visibility (a) -- (c).

The starting lineup for 3D chess has not been derived yet, but the cover
kind of gives it away. Note that a 1xN advancement manifold[]{.indexref
entry="advancement manifold:Regular region of tiles which must be empty to permit move."}
must be allowed, else straight-line moves would be illegal. Given that
starting lineup, the side effect of straight-line moves is devastating;
under both the dual path rule and the RAM rule, the rook, bishop, and
queen can all move before a single pawn has advanced. There go the
openings -- doesn't feel like chess[]{.indexref
entry="feel like chess:Play in 3D must feel like chess, a one pawn advantage wins."}.

### The advancement Square

The challenge remains; how to specify a planar move[]{.indexref
entry="planar move:A move without a trajectory in a plane which cuts a 3D board."}
such that it simultaneously preserves the standard endgames, the
midgame[]{.indexref
entry="midgame:The middle part of the game where gambits rule."}, and
the strategic principles of openings.

Perhaps we can tease some further clues out of 2D chess. If the actual
rule of motion is that the 2D advancement manifold[]{.indexref
entry="advancement manifold:Regular region of tiles which must be empty to permit move."}
can grow only as long as some set of tiles is empty, then the algorithm
for legal motion must be to add one tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
at a time and test if it's empty.

How should a 3D advancement manifold[]{.indexref
entry="advancement manifold:Regular region of tiles which must be empty to permit move."}
grow? If a line segment grows one tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
at a time, then a 'plane segment' should grow one []{#perimeter
.anchor}*perimeter*[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} at a
time. Call this an []{#advancement_square .anchor}*advancement
square*[]{.indexref
entry="advancement square:An NxN advancement manifold, must be empty for a legal move."}.

Figure 7 shows a series of snapshots of the rook's expanding advancement
square[]{.indexref
entry="advancement square:An NxN advancement manifold, must be empty for a legal move."}
for the same rook attack on the knight as in Figure 3.

![[]{#_Ref59357824 .anchor}Figure 7: The Advancement
Square](media/image8.png){alt="A picture containing diagram Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="5.805555555555555in"}

A series of 5 snapshots (a) -- (e) showing each new
perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} of the
6x6 advancement square[]{.indexref
entry="advancement square:An NxN advancement manifold, must be empty for a legal move."}
which must be empty of any other pieces for the White rook to be
attacking the Black knight. Each perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} is two
tiles larger than the previous one (3, 5, 7, 9, 11). The line of red
diamonds with black inserts represent the two rays (the inner edges of
the advancement square[]{.indexref
entry="advancement square:An NxN advancement manifold, must be empty for a legal move."}).
The presence of the knight on the perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} (outer
edges of the advancement square[]{.indexref
entry="advancement square:An NxN advancement manifold, must be empty for a legal move."})
prevents the rook from moving to those tiles (or beyond); its only legal
move on that perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} is to
capture the knight. All the diamonds are slightly smaller than a
tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
so the underlying tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}'s
color (black or white) can peek through.

The key is to constrain the advancement manifold[]{.indexref
entry="advancement manifold:Regular region of tiles which must be empty to permit move."}
to be *square*, 2x2, 3x3, ... NxN. To move a 3D rook first requires the
specification of a plane (one of three) and a quadrant (one of four).
The rook can now attack only 4 pieces per plane, for a STAB value of 12,
much more reasonable.

Figure 8 shows a series of snapshots of the rook's expanding advancement
square[]{.indexref
entry="advancement square:An NxN advancement manifold, must be empty for a legal move."}
in a vertical plane, in an upward quadrant toward Black. In this case,
the advancement square[]{.indexref
entry="advancement square:An NxN advancement manifold, must be empty for a legal move."}
shows that Black's king is in check.

Note that parts of an advancement square[]{.indexref
entry="advancement square:An NxN advancement manifold, must be empty for a legal move."}
may extend off the board, as in this example. In the case of a rook, it
leaves a rectangular shaped manifold behind (3x4). Tiles off the board
will be occasionally shown when it helps visualize a move; however, the
tiles in any part of an advancement square[]{.indexref
entry="advancement square:An NxN advancement manifold, must be empty for a legal move."}
off the board are regarded as unoccupied and thus cannot
block[]{.indexref
entry="block:Blocks cover, prevents a piece from moving to a desired location."}
the move. Obviously, a piece cannot move off the board.

Some conventions are evident in how advancement squares are going to be
presented in this work. Colored diamonds just smaller than the board
tiles will be used as []{#decorators .anchor}*decorators* to indicate
that a tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
is on some special part of the advancement square[]{.indexref
entry="advancement square:An NxN advancement manifold, must be empty for a legal move."},
something of tactical significance. Each type of piece will have its own
color. Using decorators a little smaller than the tiles allows the color
of the underlying tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
(black or white) to peek through.

The number of decorators is significant, so to avoid overwhelming the
reader, they will be introduced as needed. A summary of them is provided
in Appendix II for reference. For now, only two decorators will be used.
A plain decorator indicates a tile in the body of the advancement
square. One with a solid black diamond insert indicates a tile along one
of the two rays that specify the plane and quadrant of the move (the
*inner two edges* of the advancement square[]{.indexref
entry="advancement square:An NxN advancement manifold, must be empty for a legal move."}).
The perimeter is the *outer two edges* of the advancement square.

These conventions should be evident in the previous two figures which
show a 6x6 advancement square[]{.indexref
entry="advancement square:An NxN advancement manifold, must be empty for a legal move."}
in a horizontal plane[]{.indexref
entry="horizontal plane:Rook plane that is horizontal (a level, constant Z-axis)."},
and a 4x4 advancement square[]{.indexref
entry="advancement square:An NxN advancement manifold, must be empty for a legal move."}
in a vertical plane.

The king is covered (attacked, checked actually) by White's rook.

The piece shadows on either side of the board represent the *tray*;
where captured pieces go. These shadows serve a dual purpose; they also
label each level -- king-rook, queen-bishop, whatever.

The four quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}
are shown in two pairs for clarity. A 3x3 and a 4x4 advancement
square[]{.indexref
entry="advancement square:An NxN advancement manifold, must be empty for a legal move."}

(b). The tiles which the rook can move to on the respective perimeters
are shown with ghost rooks. Note that the 6x6 advancement
square[]{.indexref
entry="advancement square:An NxN advancement manifold, must be empty for a legal move."}
extends off the board, so the ghost rooks on those tiles are not shown.
Note also the subtle implication that linear moves will need to be dealt
with as special cases, for the tiles under them are black not red.

Advancement squares expand into quadrants; what then of linear moves?

### Obstacle #4 -- Linear Moves

A linear move[]{.indexref
entry="linear move:A move along end tiles, blocked by advancement rectangle(s)."}
in 3D presents two challenges, which will be referred to as
[]{#quadrant_ambiguity .anchor}*quadrant ambiguity*[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant ambiguity:A straight line is simultaneously in two adjacent quadrants."}
and []{#plane_ambiguity .anchor}*plane ambiguity*[]{.indexref
entry="plane ambiguity:A straight line is simultaneously in two planes (3 for duke)."}.
Recall that two planes intersect in a line. A line of tiles along a
ray[]{.indexref
entry="ray:A directed line segment of unit length that connects adjacent tiles."}
form the intersection between two planes but also form a common boundary
between two adjacent quadrants within *each* of those planes[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}.
It is ambiguous in which *quadrant* a linear move[]{.indexref
entry="linear move:A move along end tiles, blocked by advancement rectangle(s)."}
advances, and it is ambiguous in which *plane* a linear move[]{.indexref
entry="linear move:A move along end tiles, blocked by advancement rectangle(s)."}
advances; all, either, neither, both?

There are a number of possibilities here;

- let a linear move[]{.indexref
  entry="linear move:A move along end tiles, blocked by advancement rectangle(s)."}
  be legal if *any* quadrant is clear

- allow only if *all* the quadrants[]{.indexref
  entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}
  are clear

- group in pairs by plane and allow the move if *either* *pair* is clear

The first option can be easily dispensed with. In the starting lineup,
the major pieces are supposed to be blocked by the requirement of the
advancement square[]{.indexref
entry="advancement square:An NxN advancement manifold, must be empty for a legal move."},
but as we have seen, it is possible for the advancement
square[]{.indexref
entry="advancement square:An NxN advancement manifold, must be empty for a legal move."}
to extend off the board. If a linear move[]{.indexref
entry="linear move:A move along end tiles, blocked by advancement rectangle(s)."}
is allowed when *any* quadrant is clear, then the starting lineup only
blocks two of the four quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}.
For the rook, the pawn blocks motion in the horizontal plane[]{.indexref
entry="horizontal plane:Rook plane that is horizontal (a level, constant Z-axis)."}
for the quadrant extending inward, but it does not block[]{.indexref
entry="block:Blocks cover, prevents a piece from moving to a desired location."}
the quadrant that extends outward off the board. Similarly, the knight
blocks motion in each vertical plane only for the quadrant extending
downward, but it doesn't block[]{.indexref
entry="block:Blocks cover, prevents a piece from moving to a desired location."}
the quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}
that extends upward off the board. Under the *any* rule[]{.indexref
entry="any rule:Quantum move legal if there is any virtual piece for which it is legal."},
the rook, bishop and queen can all move before a single pawn moves.
We've seen this dance before; there go chess openings.

The second option can also be dispensed with. If *all*
quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}
have to be clear, then it would be four times easier to
block[]{.indexref
entry="block:Blocks cover, prevents a piece from moving to a desired location."}
a linear move[]{.indexref
entry="linear move:A move along end tiles, blocked by advancement rectangle(s)."}
as a quadrant move[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant move:A move into a quadrant, blocking is by an advancement square."};
there goes the ideal of isotropic moves. Also, in 2D chess, the lines
are independent, what happens in one has no direct[]{.indexref
entry="direct:Linear moves with two virtual quadrants reduce to a single end tile."}
effect on the other. Manifold independence (line, plane) should be an
invariant which is honored[]{.indexref
entry="invariant:A pattern which remains constant while other things change."}.
Thus, in 3D chess, the planes should be independent; what happens in one
should have no direct[]{.indexref
entry="direct:Linear moves with two virtual quadrants reduce to a single end tile."}
effect on the others.

### The Advancement Rectangle

This leaves only option three; motion is allowed if *either pair* of
adjacent quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}
are clear, one plane or the other may be blocked, but as long as both
planes are not blocked, the move is legal. However, both
quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}
in at least one plane must be clear. A linear move[]{.indexref
entry="linear move:A move along end tiles, blocked by advancement rectangle(s)."}
may occur in only one plane, or it may occur in both, depending on other
pieces. This means that the advancement manifold[]{.indexref
entry="advancement manifold:Regular region of tiles which must be empty to permit move."}
for a linear move[]{.indexref
entry="linear move:A move along end tiles, blocked by advancement rectangle(s)."}
is actually an []{#advancement_rectangle .anchor}*advancement
rectangle*[]{.indexref
entry="advancement rectangle:The advancement manifold for a linear move, both quadrants."}*.*
This is not to be confused with the debunked rectangular advancement
region (RAM[]{.indexref entry="RAM:Rectangular Advancement Manifold."})
which is part of why such a clumsy name was chosen for that concept; it
was intended to avoid later confusion.

While it is almost twice as likely to block[]{.indexref
entry="block:Blocks cover, prevents a piece from moving to a desired location."}
a linear move[]{.indexref
entry="linear move:A move along end tiles, blocked by advancement rectangle(s)."}
in a given plane, it is twice as likely to be unblocked in at least one
of the planes; that restores the ideal of isotropic moves.

Figure 10 shows three snapshots of how the advancement
rectangle[]{.indexref
entry="advancement rectangle:The advancement manifold for a linear move, both quadrants."}
grows with each new perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} in just
one plane, in this case, the horizontal plane[]{.indexref
entry="horizontal plane:Rook plane that is horizontal (a level, constant Z-axis)."}.
Note that the perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} for a
linear move[]{.indexref
entry="linear move:A move along end tiles, blocked by advancement rectangle(s)."}
grows by 5, 9, 13, ... tiles, twice as fast as for an advancement
square[]{.indexref
entry="advancement square:An NxN advancement manifold, must be empty for a legal move."}.
If any of these tiles are occupied, then an advance to that
perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} is
blocked.

![[]{#_Ref59463090 .anchor}Figure 10: Rook's Linear
Move](media/image11.png){alt="A screenshot of a video game Description automatically generated with medium confidence"
width="6.5in" height="3.4305555555555554in"}

In each plane, a linear move[]{.indexref
entry="linear move:A move along end tiles, blocked by advancement rectangle(s)."}
is ambiguous in which quadrant it advances in, so both advancement
squares must be empty for the move to be unblocked in that plane. Three
snapshots (a) -- (c) of the rook's *advancement rectangle*[]{.indexref
entry="advancement rectangle:The advancement manifold for a linear move, both quadrants."}
are shown for the horizontal plane[]{.indexref
entry="horizontal plane:Rook plane that is horizontal (a level, constant Z-axis)."}.

Figure 11 shows two complete advancement rectangles for a linear
move[]{.indexref
entry="linear move:A move along end tiles, blocked by advancement rectangle(s)."}
in the intersection of a horizontal and a vertical plane. Advance is
eventually blocked by another piece in each plane; the knight blocks the
vertical plane limiting the rook's move to perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} 2
(corresponding to two 3x3 advancement squares, i.e., a 3x5 advancement
rectangle[]{.indexref
entry="advancement rectangle:The advancement manifold for a linear move, both quadrants."}),
and the pawn blocks the horizontal plane[]{.indexref
entry="horizontal plane:Rook plane that is horizontal (a level, constant Z-axis)."}
limiting the rook's move to perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} 4
(corresponding to two 5x5 advancement squares, i.e., a 5x9 advancement
rectangle[]{.indexref
entry="advancement rectangle:The advancement manifold for a linear move, both quadrants."}).
An advancement rectangle 9 tiles long will obviously extend off the
board. Because of their larger size, it is quite common for advancement
rectangles to do so. The tile with the ghost rook (transparent) can only
be reached in the horizontal plane, two of the three previous in-line
tiles were also reachable in the vertical plane.[^11]

The advancement square has a STAB value much closer to 2D; from a low of
4 for the maximum number of simultaneous linear attacks to a high of 12
for the maximum number of simultaneous quadrant attacks.

![[]{#_Ref59464991 .anchor}Figure 11: Linear Rook Move in Horizontal and

The two advancement rectangles for a linear rook move are shown. The
vertical one is blocked by the knight, the horizontal one blocked by the
pawn. The tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
containing the ghost rook (king level) can only be reached in the
horizontal plane[]{.indexref
entry="horizontal plane:Rook plane that is horizontal (a level, constant Z-axis)."},
the first two linear tiles are reachable in both planes.

### Loss of Trajectory

The implication of an advancement manifold[]{.indexref
entry="advancement manifold:Regular region of tiles which must be empty to permit move."}
is that a piece does not have a []{#quadrants
.anchor}*trajectory*[]{.indexref
entry="trajectory:A unique path (a sequence of tiles) from one tile to another."}
from its source tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
to its destination tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."};
there is no unique sequence of tiles which it traversed. This is a bit
of a surprise, but the steps that led here are inescapable once the
commitment is made to hold discovery[]{.indexref
entry="discovery:Rules to 3D chess must be discovered, not invented."}
ascendant over invention[]{.indexref
entry="invention:Simple primitives chosen to lead to complex play."}.
Who would make up such a rule? It violates our everyday experience, all
the perceptual algorithms that evolution has built into us over millions
of years, and even violates the early development of science, now[^12]
referred to as classical physics.

In 2D chess, it was possible to pretend that a move had a definite
trajectory[]{.indexref
entry="trajectory:A unique path (a sequence of tiles) from one tile to another."},
a uniquely specified sequence of tiles connecting the source
tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
with the destination tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}.
In 3D chess, the pretense of a trajectory[]{.indexref
entry="trajectory:A unique path (a sequence of tiles) from one tile to another."}
is no longer tenable. The loss of trajectory[]{.indexref
entry="trajectory:A unique path (a sequence of tiles) from one tile to another."}
violates common sense in deeply profound ways.[^13]

In classical physics, it was possible to pretend that an object in
motion had a definite path, a specific and unique sequence of
intermediate points, but according to quantum physics, it doesn't and
never did. Neither was there ever a trajectory[]{.indexref
entry="trajectory:A unique path (a sequence of tiles) from one tile to another."}
in 2D chess, but the physicality of the pieces, the very act of picking
one up and moving it, deceived us. Paradigms are strong barriers.

Motion is not classical; it is fundamentally quantum. The
perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} of the
advancement square[]{.indexref
entry="advancement square:An NxN advancement manifold, must be empty for a legal move."}
is a portent of the concept of an advancing wave front. How did that
happen? By a disciplined adherence to the discovery[]{.indexref
entry="discovery:Rules to 3D chess must be discovered, not invented."}
principle.

3D chess is an example of a game that is echoing fundamental principles
of physical reality, even, to a tiny degree, the historical progression
from a naÃ¯ve classical view of motion to a more refined quantum view of
motion. How very delightful -- how very unexpected.

Had the loss of trajectory[]{.indexref
entry="trajectory:A unique path (a sequence of tiles) from one tile to another."}
been recognized in classical chess long ago, then it might not have been
such a scientific shock to discover[]{.indexref
entry="discover:A piece which when moved unblocks an attack from another piece."}
that an electron in an excited atom is *first* in one orbital, *then* in
another, but is *never*, *ever* anywhere in between.

"Oh," we might have said, "it's just like chess."

The ancient Greeks' love of philosophy lead to many inventive ideas on
the ultimate nature of reality, but until the rise of the scientific
method, little progress was made discovering the correct laws that truly
reveal the nature of reality; discovery[]{.indexref
entry="discovery:Rules to 3D chess must be discovered, not invented."}
is ascendant over invention[]{.indexref
entry="invention:Simple primitives chosen to lead to complex play."}.

Our commonsense paradigm of motion is *classical*. Therefore, we
typically invent games where pieces advance along well defined and
unique trajectories, but adherence to the discovery principle reveals
that trajectories are an *illusion*.

The trajectory[]{.indexref
entry="trajectory:A unique path (a sequence of tiles) from one tile to another."}
paradigm, like all paradigms, seems *so opaque* on the front end, and so
*bloody transparent* on the back end. It is one of the strong reasons to
believe that the planar move[]{.indexref
entry="planar move:A move without a trajectory in a plane which cuts a 3D board."},
constrained by the advancement square[]{.indexref
entry="advancement square:An NxN advancement manifold, must be empty for a legal move."},
supports the hope that for 3D chess there just might be, *one right rule
set*[]{.indexref
entry="one right rule set:The thesis that there is just one right rule set for 3D chess."}.

## The Fundamentals

This chapter lays out a formal development of the board size, shape, and
pieces. The primary guide is to determine which invariants in 2D chess
scale.

### Rule Invariants

An []{#invariant .anchor}*invariant*[]{.indexref
entry="invariant:A pattern which remains constant while other things change."}
is an aspect of a system that doesn't change while other things do. Some
invariants will be fundamental, others coincidental. The fundamental
invariants are the true genesis of "chess-ness." A fundamental
invariant[]{.indexref
entry="invariant:A pattern which remains constant while other things change."}
is one that scales; it must be dimension agnostic[]{.indexref
entry="dimension agnostic:Rules of chess which scale to higher dimensions as invariants."}.

For instance, the 2D chess board consists of 64 squares. If this is a
fundamental invariant[]{.indexref
entry="invariant:A pattern which remains constant while other things change."},
it should scale, thus a 3D board should be 4x4x4. Actually, that's
pretty close to the prop in the original Star Trek (one level of 16
squares was split into 4 mini boards of 2x2 squares off to the
side).[^14]

Does it scale? What would a 4D board look like with 64 squares? Hmmm,
the 4^th^ root of 64 is not integral; 2.83 x 2.83 x 2.83 x 2.83 --
that's not going to work.[^15]

### The Congruent Rules of Chess[]{.indexref entry="Congruent Rules of Chess:Rules of chess phrased to be dimension agnostic, 2D, 3D, 4D, etc."}

The existence of invariants allows the rules of chess to be phrased so
they are largely dimension agnostic[]{.indexref
entry="dimension agnostic:Rules of chess which scale to higher dimensions as invariants."}.
Recast in this way they will be referred to as the
[]{#Congruent_Rules_of_Chess .anchor}*Congruent Rules of
Chess*[]{.indexref
entry="Congruent Rules of Chess:Rules of chess phrased to be dimension agnostic, 2D, 3D, 4D, etc."}.
They will be introduced as we encounter them. They are summarized as a
set in Appendix I.

### Board Shape

While obviously the shape of the board must change in order to have
chess in three dimensions, the *sequence* of board shapes can have
properties that are invariant[]{.indexref
entry="invariant:A pattern which remains constant while other things change."}.
Consider; if the 2D board is a square of squares (8x8), then the 3D
board would be a cube of cubes (8x8x8), and the 4D board could be a
hypercube of hypercubes (8x8x8x8), ad infinitum; now there is an
invariant[]{.indexref
entry="invariant:A pattern which remains constant while other things change."}
that scales!

[]{#_Toc210218224 .anchor}Congruent Rule **:** **A chess board *is* a
regular array of regular things.**

In crystallography, the unit cell is the basis for a regular array of
regular things. To help distinguish adjacent unit cells (squares, cubes,
etc.) they alternate colors, another invariant[]{.indexref
entry="invariant:A pattern which remains constant while other things change."}
that scales.

[]{#_Toc210218225 .anchor}Congruent Rule : **Unit cells (tiles)
alternate between two colors, typically white and black.**

The range[]{.indexref
entry="range:What percentage of the board a piece can eventually reach."}
of the unrestricted pieces should also be dimension agnostic[]{.indexref
entry="dimension agnostic:Rules of chess which scale to higher dimensions as invariants."}.
They can move the full extent of the board; fore and aft, or left and
right, and of course in 3D, or up and down. No dimension is special.

[]{#_Toc210218226 .anchor}Congruent Rule : **Unrestricted pieces may
move the full extent of the board**.

Under these congruent rules[]{.indexref
entry="congruent rules:Rules for chess which are dimension agnostic."},
all chess boards are symmetric, a 90Â° rotation changes nothing except
converting white tiles into black tiles and vice versa.

Figure 12 shows the 2D board as a square of squares and the 3D board as
a cube of cubes.

![[]{#_Ref59009309 .anchor}Figure 12: Board
Shape](media/image13.png){alt="A picture containing text, clipart Description automatically generated"
width="4.513888888888889in" height="2.388888888888889in"}

If the 2D board is a square of squares, then the 3D board should be a
cube of cubes. A square is the proper unit cell for 2D, a cube the
proper unit cell for 3D. In any dimension, adjacent orthogonal unit
cells alternate colors (white & black).

### Rays

Since the chess board has changed, being able to tie how pieces move to
the topology of the board can go a long way towards finding invariants
that are dimension agnostic[]{.indexref
entry="dimension agnostic:Rules of chess which scale to higher dimensions as invariants."}.
Geometry provides the necessary clue.

A []{#ray .anchor}*ray*[]{.indexref
entry="ray:A directed line segment of unit length that connects adjacent tiles."}
is a directed line segment of unit length that extends from the source
tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
to an adjacent tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}.
Rays come in a few simple types, determined by how many cartesian
coordinates change when advancing along one. A ray[]{.indexref
entry="ray:A directed line segment of unit length that connects adjacent tiles."}
that changes only one coordinate extends through the side of a square or
the face of a cube. One that changes two coordinates extends through a
square's corner or a cube's edge. One that changes all three
coordinates, extends through a cube's vertex.

In 2D, there are two types of rays: *side rays*, and *corner rays*. In
3D, there are three types of rays: *face rays*, []{#edge_ray
.anchor}*edge rays*[]{.indexref
entry="edge ray:Unit length ray that points to adjacent cube through an edge."},
and []{#vertex_ray .anchor}*vertex rays*[]{.indexref entry="âvertex"}.
Side and []{#face_ray .anchor}face rays change only one coordinate. Each
additional ray[]{.indexref
entry="ray:A directed line segment of unit length that connects adjacent tiles."}
type changes an additional coordinate.

### Base Pieces

A square has 8 nearest neighbors (3x3 - 1); 4 connected by sides, 4
connected by corners; *two* types. The rook advances along a side
ray[]{.indexref
entry="side ray:Unit length ray that points to adjacent square through a side."},
the bishop along a corner ray[]{.indexref
entry="corner ray:Unit length ray that points to adjacent square through a corner."}.

In 2D the rook and bishop are []{#base_piece .anchor}*base pieces*; all
the other pieces can be defined in terms of them. The queen is the sum,
the knight the anti-queen (very anti, limited range, can't even be
blocked). The king is a short-range[]{.indexref
entry="range:What percentage of the board a piece can eventually reach."}
queen, and the pawn, just to mix things up a bit, advances like a rook,
but captures like a bishop, with restrictions on range[]{.indexref
entry="range:What percentage of the board a piece can eventually reach."}
and direction.

Promoting up a dimension, the cube has 26 neighbors (3x3x3 - 1); 6
connected by faces, 12 connected by edges, and 8 connected by vertices;
*three* types.

Sounds like a 3D rook should advance along face rays. When a rook
advances to the next square through a side it uses a ray[]{.indexref
entry="ray:A directed line segment of unit length that connects adjacent tiles."}
that changes only one coordinate number. When it advances to the next
cube through a face, it uses a ray[]{.indexref
entry="ray:A directed line segment of unit length that connects adjacent tiles."}
that changes only one coordinate number. If it advanced to the next
hypercube through a hypersurface, it would still use a ray[]{.indexref
entry="ray:A directed line segment of unit length that connects adjacent tiles."}
that changes only one coordinate number. A consequence of the property
of changing only one coordinate number is that a rook, in any dimension,
can reach every location on the board. Here is a scalable
invariant[]{.indexref
entry="invariant:A pattern which remains constant while other things change."}.

[]{#_Toc210218227 .anchor}Congruent Rule : **Rooks advance along rays
which change only *one* coordinate.**

Should the 3D bishop move through edges, or vertices, or both? Should
chess have two base pieces or one base piece[]{.indexref
entry="base piece:A piece which moves along only 1 type of ray; rook, bishop, duke."}
per dimension? These are degenerate invariants in 2D. Which
invariant[]{.indexref
entry="invariant:A pattern which remains constant while other things change."}
is fundamental? Which one should be shunned, and one which should be
honored?

In 2D, the corner of a square has a dual nature; moving through corners
changes *two* coordinates, but it also changes *all* the coordinates
there are. In 3D, the vertex of a cube has a dual nature; moving through
vertices changes *three* of the coordinates, but it also changes *all*
the coordinates there are. Should a bishop advance along rays that
change *two* coordinates, or along rays that change *all* the
coordinates?

The above dilemma is common when promoting from a lower abstraction to a
higher one. Unavoidably, some rules or features in a lower abstraction
will be ambiguous; there will be two or more equivalent descriptions, a
*conceptual degeneracy*[]{.indexref
entry="conceptual degeneracy:Two descriptions only equivalent at a lower level of abstraction."},
but when promoted to the higher abstraction the degeneracy is broken and
the two descriptions are seen to be different.

This one turns out to be easy to resolve.

If the 3D bishop advances through edges only, it can reach just half the
tiles on the board, and they are all the same color (same as the 2D
bishop). If it advances through vertices only, it can reach just a
quarter of the tiles on the board, and they are half white and half
black (not like the 2D bishop). If it advances through both, it can
reach all the tiles on the board, and thus change color (not at all like
the 2D bishop). Therefore, to maintain chess-like behavior, the 3D
bishop should advance only through edges.

[]{#_Toc210218228 .anchor}Congruent Rule : **Bishops advance along rays
which change *two* coordinates**.

### Royal Pieces

In 2D, the queen, as the sum of the rook and bishop, can cover all the
nearest neighbors (8). In 3D, with the bishop limited to advancing
exclusively through edges, she would only be able to attack 18 of the 26
nearest neighbors; the 8 vertices would be disallowed. Is it a
fundamental invariant[]{.indexref
entry="invariant:A pattern which remains constant while other things change."}
that the queen can cover all the nearest neighbors or is this a
coincidental invariant[]{.indexref
entry="invariant:A pattern which remains constant while other things change."}?

In 2D, the king likewise can cover all the nearest neighbors (8). In 3D,
should the king be able to still cover all the nearest neighbors (26)?
If the bishop can only advance along rays which change two coordinates,
then there is no base piece[]{.indexref
entry="base piece:A piece which moves along only 1 type of ray; rook, bishop, duke."}
which moves through vertices. Thus, the queen (as the sum of the 3D base
pieces) would not be able to attack all the nearest neighbors. Which in
turn implies that a king could attack a queen but not be attacked in
return. Furthermore, if the knight is the anti-queen (the only piece
that can attack the queen without a counterattack) then the knight might
be able to move to vertices and that doesn't look at all like a knight's
move and doesn't project a 2D knight's move onto a two-dimensional
surface. The implication is clear.

[]{#_Toc210218229 .anchor}Congruent Rule : **Chess requires a base
piece**[]{.indexref
entry="base piece:A piece which moves along only 1 type of ray; rook, bishop, duke."}
**for every dimension.**

### Introducing the Duke

The new base piece[]{.indexref
entry="base piece:A piece which moves along only 1 type of ray; rook, bishop, duke."}
must advance through vertices. 'Vertices' is an awkward word, but it was
useful to make clear the differences between the unit cell of 2D, the
square (which has sides and corners), and the unit cell of 3D, the cube
(which has faces, edges, and vertices). From now on the term *corner*
will be used interchangeably trusting the context to disambiguate.

The new base piece[]{.indexref
entry="base piece:A piece which moves along only 1 type of ray; rook, bishop, duke."}
is called a *duke*[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."}, it
advances along rays that change three coordinates. It can reach only a
quarter of the tiles on the board, half as many as the bishop, just like
the bishop can reach only half as many tiles as the rook.

The geometry is beautiful; a rook's advance changes one coordinate
value, a bishop's advance changes two, and a duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."}'s advance
changes three. In both 2D & 3D chess, the rook can reach every
tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
on the board, the bishop can reach half the tiles on the board, and in
3D chess the duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} can reach a
quarter of the tiles on the board. This is a derivative
invariant[]{.indexref
entry="invariant:A pattern which remains constant while other things change."}.

[]{#_Toc210218230 .anchor}Congruent Rule : **Each new base
piece**[]{.indexref
entry="base piece:A piece which moves along only 1 type of ray; rook, bishop, duke."}
**can reach only half as many tiles as the previous one.**

There is no hard invariant[]{.indexref
entry="invariant:A pattern which remains constant while other things change."}
in 2D chess about the names of the pieces. However, there is a soft
invariant[]{.indexref
entry="invariant:A pattern which remains constant while other things change."}.

[]{#_Toc210218231 .anchor}Congruent Rule : **Piece names derive largely
from a medieval motif.**

The choice of 'duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."}' as the
name of the next base piece[]{.indexref
entry="base piece:A piece which moves along only 1 type of ray; rook, bishop, duke."}
fits this motif, with the added benefit that its name starts with a
different letter than any other piece, maintaining clear chess notation.

It seems we have our base pieces.

Figure 13 shows the topological basis for base pieces. Adjacent cells
are connected by rays which change one to three coordinates. A
consistent color scheme for adjacent cells (tiles) is used. It shows the
adjacent squares of 2D (a) and the adjacent cubes of 3D (b) color coded
as red, green, and blue; for the rook, bishop, and duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."}
respectively.

![[]{#_Ref59014052 .anchor}Figure 13: Base Pieces Derive from Adjacent
Unit
Cells](media/image14.png){alt="A picture containing text, clock Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="5.182638888888889in"}

The base pieces derive from the topology of the board, a
multi-dimensional array of unit cells. Each type of adjacent cell is
connected by a ray of a different type, which can be ordered by the
number of coordinates it changes. The unit cell of 2D is the square (a),
it has two nearest neighbors; 4 connected by sides (rook), and 4
connected by corners (bishop). Two types of rays connect squares; side
rays which change 1 coordinate, and corner rays which change 2
coordinates (a). The unit cell in 3D is the cube (b), it has 26 nearest
neighbors; 6 connected by faces (rook), 12 connected by edges (bishop),
and 8 connected by vertices (duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."}). Three
types of rays connect cubes; face rays which change 1 coordinate, edge
rays[]{.indexref
entry="edge ray:Unit length ray that points to adjacent cube through an edge."}
which change 2 coordinates, and vertex rays[]{.indexref entry="âvertex"}
which change 3 coordinates. Red, green, and blue form the basis of a
consistent color scheme.

In 2D, rooks advance along rays which change only one coordinate,
transitioning through the sides between squares, bishops advance along
rays which change two coordinates, transitioning through corners between
squares.

In 3D, rooks advance along rays which change only one coordinate,
transitioning through the faces between cubes, bishops advance along
rays which change two coordinates, transitioning through edges between
cubes, and dukes advance along rays which change three coordinates,
transitioning corners (vertices) between cubes.

A deep gray (almost black) will generally be used to indicate the source
tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}.

### Presentation Layer

Because of the complexity of 3D chess, it is useful pedagogy to
establish some presentation standards. The first of these is to
associate a color with each base piece.

While this color standard will be closely adhered to, minor deviations
will be used to communicate subtle points (mostly varying tints). For
those who might wish to create figures or display software to this
standard, the 8-bit RGB value of the chosen blue tint is (0, 211, 255).
(Pure blue, 0,0,255, was too dark.)

### Board Size

Time to review; the 2D board is 8 tiles long, long enough to hold all a
player's pieces in two straight lines. But now, with the addition of the
duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."}, there are
more pieces. Assuming the duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} lines up as
a pair around the royal pieces (like the rook, bishop, and knight) the
3D board is going to have to be 10 tiles long. That implies a 3D board
of 10x10x10, for 1,000 tiles.

Back to the invariant[]{.indexref
entry="invariant:A pattern which remains constant while other things change."}
question; is the chess board 8 tiles long, or is it long enough to hold
all the pieces? There are so many variations here that considering them
all in detail becomes tedious. Therefore, the major rejected variations
will be critiqued with a single sentence and critics are free to object
as they see fit.

- 10x10x10 separates the pawns too far; yields major piece war followed
  by a pawn war.

- 8x8x10 violates rotational symmetry; busts the pawn race endgames.

- Placing the dukes off edge allow them to move prior to the pawns;
  busts openings.

- Half the offline positions prevent the dukes from attacking any piece
  in the starting lineup; degrades gambits.

- No dukes start the game, but queens can move like one and pawns can
  promote[]{.indexref
  entry="promote:Reaching the home column, a pawn upgrades to a more powerful piece."}
  to one; odd.

A trial solution to return the board to 8x8x8 is to place the
duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} on the same
tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
as the bishop. Now all the pieces fit on the board.

[]{#_Toc210218232 .anchor}Congruent Rule : **The length of a chess board
is 8 tiles.**

### Introducing the Stack

However, placing the duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} on the same
tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
as the bishop violates the one piece, one tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
invariant[]{.indexref
entry="invariant:A pattern which remains constant while other things change."}.

[]{#_Toc210218233 .anchor}Congruent Rule : **A tile**[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
**may be empty or contain one and only one piece.**

The solution proposed here is to start the duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} on top of
the bishop as a composite piece called the *stack*[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."}. As
a composite piece, it moves differently than its component parts and can
thus be rightly regarded as a single piece. However, as a composite
piece it can also separate into its component parts. This preserves the
one-tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
one-piece invariant[]{.indexref
entry="invariant:A pattern which remains constant while other things change."}.

Fully justifying this choice cannot be done at this stage of
development. In "Chapter 3: The Board and Pieces" the stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."} will
be formally presented, and further arguments for its existence and
properties will be considered in "Chapter 10: Stack."

[]{#_Toc210218234 .anchor}Congruent Rule : **All base pieces except the
rook may be combined into a composite piece.**

## The Board and Pieces

The board size and shape have been determined, as have the pieces that
should go on it. However, it seems appropriate to have a piece design
unique to 3D, and there is still the task of determining where the
pieces should start.

### Piece Design[]{.indexref entry="Piece Design:The design of each pieces âalludesâ to how it moves."}

Before considering the starting lineup, a piece design should be
selected. Most chess piece designs allude to the move rule for that
piece; the rook (castle) will have four ramparts, one for each
orthogonal direction, the bishop a slotted helmet to indicate its
diagonal move, the queen has eight points on her crown for her eight
directions, the knight's horse head turns to the side, etc.

A conventional design is entirely workable, but a highly stylized,
futuristic look seemed more appropriate, if the pieces could be
intuitively identified and maintain the allude standard.

[]{#_Toc210218235 .anchor}Congruent Rule : **The design of each piece
alludes to how it moves.**

Since we have not yet fully discussed how the pieces move, we are
getting a bit ahead of ourselves, but having a starting lineup
facilitates that very discussion, so a classic chicken and egg problem
prevents a clean linear presentation. As the move for each piece is
presented, the connection with that move and its shape will become
evident and will be explicitly called out.

Figure 14 shows a rendition of the 3D piece design in the Blender 3D
modeling application. In order from left to right they are; king, queen,
rook, bishop, duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."}, two
knights (with opposite parity), stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."} (the
combined bishop and duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."}), and the
pawn. This design is not far from conventional designs and should be
easily recognizable. Only the bishop and the duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} might be a
tad confusing at first, but stacked they appear how a 'post-modern' 2D
bishop might look.

![[]{#_Ref64646898 .anchor}Figure 14: 3D Chess Piece Design[]{.indexref
entry="Piece Design:The design of each pieces âalludesâ to how it moves."}](media/image15.png){width="6.5in"
height="2.2465277777777777in"}

Each of the 3D chess pieces allude to how they move in 3D. From left to
right they are; king, queen, rook, bishop, duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."}, knights
(with opposite parity), stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."} (the
combined bishop and duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."}), and the
pawn. In this rendition, the basic shapes have been covered with a
marbled surface.

For the Intrepid Reader who takes a perverse pride in getting to where
the author is heading but first, the shapes offer clues to the proposed
move set; particularly the base pieces and knight.

### Starting Lineup[]{.indexref entry="Starting Lineup:The initial position of the chess pieces at the start of the game."}

There are several invariants of the starting lineup in 2D to consider.
There is a dual line for both players with a pawn for every major piece.
The dual line extends the full breadth of the board. The dual lines are
on opposite extents of the board. The major pieces mirror each other
around the royal pieces. Half the tiles have a piece. That last one
seems dubious, it would imply 256 pieces on the 3D board, probably with
128 pawns -- enough said.

Pressing on, notice that the line of major pieces (being a line) changes
only one coordinate number. Considering the major piece line as a
reference, the pawns change the other coordinate. Once again, the
some/all conceptual degeneracy[]{.indexref
entry="conceptual degeneracy:Two descriptions only equivalent at a lower level of abstraction."}
confronts us. Does each pawn change just the *one* unused coordinate
from its major piece, or does it change *all* the unused coordinates? In
the former case, there are lots of ways to structure a starting lineup;
pretty much any straight line[]{.indexref
entry="straight line:Orthogonal (rook), diagonal (bishop)."} on opposing
faces of the board will suffice. Even diagonal lines are an option. For
all these options, getting the Black and White pieces to be fully
opposed to each other is, however, awkward at best.

To resolve the degeneracy, consider standard *chess notation*, where the
files are identified by the major pieces (K, KB, QR, etc.) and the ranks
are identified by number (1 to 8). If the *all* option is taken, then a
pawn starts on K2, or K2,2 or K2,2,2 (for 4D); this is the
invariant[]{.indexref
entry="invariant:A pattern which remains constant while other things change."}
that scales.

[]{#_Toc210218236 .anchor}Congruent Rule : **Pieces start in two lines
opposed on 2^nd^ highest order feature, pawns in *front*.**

Therefore, the major pieces should start on opposite edges of the board
with their respective pawns in front. There are 12 edges, thus 6 edge
pairs, and by symmetry they are technically all equivalent. However, a
physical board made out of levels breaks this symmetry, gravity and all
that, so the natural solution is to select a pair of *vertical* edges.
This means each level can be referred to by its base piece[]{.indexref
entry="base piece:A piece which moves along only 1 type of ray; rook, bishop, duke."}
(king level, queen-knight level, etc.). It also means the players start
face to face on an equal footing. A pair of horizontal edges would have
one Player looking down at the other. This separates the 3D pawns by
four tiles (diagonally), just as they are separated by four tiles
(orthogonally) in 2D.

Now to select *which pair* of opposing vertical edges to use. This same
challenge exists on the 2D chess board and a sure sign of novices
playing chess is when they go against convention and place the White
king rook on a black square rather than on a white one. For a folding
board, the correct orientation[]{.indexref
entry="orientation:Move from active to fixed piece is either quadrant or linear."}
has the fold separate the players. For both solid and rollup boards, the
players have to pay a little more attention; while just a convention,
there is no good reason to violate it.

[]{#_Toc210218237 .anchor}Congruent Rule : **White king rook starts on a
white tile**[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}**.**

This does have side effects; the Black king rook will also start on a
white tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."},
and the pseudo rule, 'Queen on her own color' no longer works; both
queens start on white tiles. The equivalent rule in 3D chess is that the
king starts on the level above the queen.

Figure 15 shows the starting lineup.

![[]{#_Ref58846982 .anchor}Figure 15: Starting Lineup[]{.indexref
entry="Starting Lineup:The initial position of the chess pieces at the start of the game."}](media/image16.png){alt="A picture containing text Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="6.846527777777778in"}

Opponents face each other on opposite extents of the board. The major
pieces mirror each other around the royal pieces, pawns in front. The
White king-side rook starts on a white tile. In 2D, they align along
opposing sides (a), in 3D, they align along opposing vertical columns
(b)[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}.
Stack starts next to the royal pieces (bishop level). King is above the
queen, so both queens start on white tiles. Pawns are on
tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
2,2 (left, right; from each player's perspective) and
promote[]{.indexref
entry="promote:Reaching the home column, a pawn upgrades to a more powerful piece."}
only on the opponent's home column (8,8). The piece trays lie outside
the board, serving to ID each level. On each level a thin border
surrounds the center 4x4 grid of tiles; easier to visualize multi-level
moves.

The convention in this book is that White lines up on the right, even
though she moves first. This is in contrast to the usual idiom of
starting from left to right. The justification for this choice is that
if one takes a 2D board as seen from White's perspective and tilts it
vertical so that the king is on top of the queen, one ends up with White
on the right. This particular 'rule' is rather arbitrary and as a mere
convention might well morph the other way around over time. However, it
won't much matter when played on a computer as each player will simply
rotate the board per taste and may well prefer a White or Black
dominated perspective, rather than the neutral one used here.

The 1,1 vertical column, from each player's perspective, is the home
column, with the respective pawn columns at 2,2.

[]{#_Toc210218238 .anchor}Congruent Rule : **A pawn's promotion
tile**[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
**is any of the opponent's home tiles (8,8).**

[]{#_Toc210218239 .anchor}Congruent Rule : **White moves first.**

A couple of visual tricks have been used to improve board presentation.
For instance, a thin line borders the inner 4x4 grid of tiles on each
level; this aids in aligning moves which span multiple levels. In
addition, the black and white tiles are tinted slightly darker at lower
levels; this helps ameliorate the moirÃ© pattern.

Most significantly, the levels overlap. Depending on the needs of the
topic, the degree of overlap will be greater or lessor. More overlap
keeps the board closer to its formal definition of being a cube, but at
the cost of hiding tiles and any pieces on them. Less overlap allows
more of the board to be visible, but at the cost of vertically
elongating the board which puts an undo emphasize on levels.

Formally, from the perspective of the rules, the board *is a cube*,
vertical planes are just as important as horizontal planes, but as we
are not yet four-dimensional beings, we are prevented from seeing (and
reaching) inside a truly cubical 3D board. There is a perceptual cost to
this, levels dominate the view when the game itself, with the exception
of the pawns, is level agnostic, but it is an unavoidable compromise. A
good computer-based presentation layer can ameliorate this compromise to
some degree.

### Chess Notation[]{.indexref entry="Chess Notation:Concise way to capture moves or a specific position."}

Chess notation on this board is easy and natural; P -- K4,4. Coordinate
order is from each player's perspective; piece, 'dash', level, left
distance, 'comma,' right distance. A pawn move by White to KB3,4 will be
seen from Black's perspective to be on tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
KB6,5; each opposing pair of indices should sum to 9.

Such moves can also be annotated, such as 'x' for capture or 'ch' for
check, and of course '!' for a good move and '?' for a questionable one.
3D chess requires a larger list of annotations. They will be introduced
as needed.

For instance, a list of the classic Ruy Lopez opening of 2D chess might
(duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} plays the
bishop role in this opening) look something like this. This is not
actually a strong opening in 3D chess, for reasons that will become
apparent; it is intended to show how move notation looks, but from a
framework the reader is likely familiar with.

[WHITE]{.underline} [BLACK]{.underline}

1 P -- K4,4 P -- K4,4

2 N -- KB3,3 N -- QB3,3?

3 D -- QN5,5 P -- QR4,3!

Analysis of openings will be covered in Chapter 21. We still need to
finish discovering how the pieces move, so once again, we are a bit
ahead of ourselves.

A succinct notation for an initial position is desired to facilitate
chess puzzles[]{.indexref
entry="chess puzzles:Limited objective practice situations which stress chess principles"}.
Capturing the state of the board is done similarly,

[WHITE]{.underline} [BLACK]{.underline}

R @ K5,4 K @ Q2,3

K @ Q8,3

which is the initial position for the single rook mate of Figure 1 and
Figure 2.

# Part II -- How the Pieces Move

Part I addressed two challenges, the trajectory[]{.indexref
entry="trajectory:A unique path (a sequence of tiles) from one tile to another."}
paradigm and a formal development process to uncover a consistent
foundation for the rules. The trajectory[]{.indexref
entry="trajectory:A unique path (a sequence of tiles) from one tile to another."}
paradigm was breached by the introduction of the planar move[]{.indexref
entry="planar move:A move without a trajectory in a plane which cuts a 3D board."}
and the constraint of advancement squares; it is what most distinguishes
this variation from others.

The formal development process focused on identifying those invariants
of 2D chess that were dimension agnostic[]{.indexref
entry="dimension agnostic:Rules of chess which scale to higher dimensions as invariants."};
those that can scale to larger dimensions and which capture the true
"chess-ness" of chess. The result of that effort was a good start on the
congruent rules[]{.indexref
entry="congruent rules:Rules for chess which are dimension agnostic."}
of chess, a formalism intended to protect us from the temptation of
invention. We continue to grow the congruent rules[]{.indexref
entry="congruent rules:Rules for chess which are dimension agnostic."}
of chess in Part II for the same reason.

Part II extends this start, applying the planar idiom to each piece. The
idea that a pair of rays determine a plane, and that for each base
piece, the type of pair (and type of plane) is different, allows the
idea of the planar move to be extended in a natural and intuitive way.
The need for a third base piece is hardly surprising, many other
approaches to 3D chess have introduced one, and for largely the same
reasons. How the rest of the pieces move can be defined in terms of the
base pieces; the queen is the sum, the pawn advances like a rook, but
captures like a bishop or duke (all with restricted range and
direction), and the king is a limited range queen. Even the knight's
move derives from the base pieces, albeit in a kind of anti-base piece
way.

We will also be looking to confirm that the projection of the 3D move
onto 2D does in fact yield the 2D move, as one more guide rail to keep
us on the discovery path.

Implicitly, we have been developing a jargon for 3D chess. Through the
rest of this book, we shall be a bit more formal about this basic
pedagogy. First use will be in *italics*. Appendix III holds the Jargon
Table, where each term is hyperlinked to the first occurrence of the
term in the text. The terms are listed in chronological order, grouped
by chapter. For an alphabetical list, see the index.

Clearly defined terms are essential when trying to communicate and/or
master a complicated subject. The strategy is to choose (ok, invent)
meaningful names that are simple and intuitive but capture the concept.
Acronyms have been kept to a minimum.

## The Bedrock

By choosing scalable invariants, it has been possible to
discover[]{.indexref
entry="discover:A piece which when moved unblocks an attack from another piece."}
the correct size and shape of the board (8x8x8), tie how pieces advance
to the topology of the board (through the concepts of rays and base
pieces), discover[]{.indexref
entry="discover:A piece which when moved unblocks an attack from another piece."}
the need for a new base piece[]{.indexref
entry="base piece:A piece which moves along only 1 type of ray; rook, bishop, duke."}
and name it (the duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."}), and even,
tentatively, propose the need for a composite piece (the
stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."}). It
was also possible to determine a starting lineup, a generalized chess
notation, and with a little future hindsight, establish a post-modern
yet mnemonic design for the pieces.

### Invariants

Before dealing with each piece, a quick review of the invariants already
discovered will allow us to expand the list of congruent
rules[]{.indexref
entry="congruent rules:Rules for chess which are dimension agnostic."}
while avoiding duplication later.

The first chapter (on the trajectory[]{.indexref
entry="trajectory:A unique path (a sequence of tiles) from one tile to another."}
paradigm), revealed that one of the critical invariants in chess was to
freeze the difference between the dimensions of the board space and the
dimensions of the move space to precisely one. This
invariant[]{.indexref
entry="invariant:A pattern which remains constant while other things change."}
is dimension agnostic[]{.indexref
entry="dimension agnostic:Rules of chess which scale to higher dimensions as invariants."},
and so scales perfectly. Thus, pieces move in straight lines in 2D, flat
planes in 3D, and would move in cubes in 4D. This preserved the
endgames.

[]{#_Toc210218240 .anchor}Congruent Rule : **Base pieces move in a space
one dimension less than the board.**

It was also discovered that blocking required us to resolve the
degenerate 2D advance rule into an invariant[]{.indexref
entry="invariant:A pattern which remains constant while other things change."}
form. Thus, pieces may move until blocked, but blocking is not defined
as "until running into another piece" but rather as "a regular set of
tiles (called a manifold) which must be empty." Thus, advancement
manifolds are a straight line[]{.indexref
entry="straight line:Orthogonal (rook), diagonal (bishop)."} in 2D which
grows by one tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
at-a-time, a square in 3D which grows by one perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."}
at-a-time, and a cube in 4D which would grow by one 3-faced surface
at-a-time, etc. Perimeter will be used as the generic term for the
advancing element of any advancement manifold. This preserved the
midgame[]{.indexref
entry="midgame:The middle part of the game where gambits rule."}.

[]{#_Toc210218241 .anchor}Congruent Rule : **A piece may advance only as
long as the next perimeter**[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} **is
empty.**

Furthermore, the advancement manifolds are oriented differently for
different base pieces, being defined by N-1 rays of the same type.
That's the scalable invariant[]{.indexref
entry="invariant:A pattern which remains constant while other things change."}.
Thus, there are two types of advancement manifolds in 2D defined by
*single* rays; orthogonal lines defined by one side ray[]{.indexref
entry="side ray:Unit length ray that points to adjacent square through a side."},
and diagonal lines defined by one corner ray[]{.indexref
entry="corner ray:Unit length ray that points to adjacent square through a corner."}.
By extension, there are three types of advancement manifolds in 3D
defined by *pairs* of rays; *orthogonal planes* which are defined by two
face rays, *skew planes* defined by two edge rays[]{.indexref
entry="edge ray:Unit length ray that points to adjacent cube through an edge."},
and *slant planes* defined by two corner (vertex) rays. The extension to
4D is straight forward.

[]{#_Toc210218242 .anchor}Congruent Rule : **An advancement
manifold**[]{.indexref
entry="advancement manifold:Regular region of tiles which must be empty to permit move."}
**is defined by N-1 rays of the same type.**

One of the consequences of this is that all the base pieces can move to
any of the tiles they can reach in just two moves. With the debunked
straight-line move[]{.indexref
entry="straight-line move:A move in a straight line which cuts a 2D board."},
it would have taken three moves; and by extension four moves in 4D.

[]{#_Toc210218243 .anchor}Congruent Rule : **A base piece**[]{.indexref
entry="base piece:A piece which moves along only 1 type of ray; rook, bishop, duke."}
**can move to any tile**[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
**it can reach in just two moves.**

To eliminate quadrant and plane ambiguities, a distinction was required
between quadrant and linear moves. A linear move is legal in any plane
in which the two adjacent quadrants are unblocked, that is, the
advancement squares combine into a single advancement rectangle. This
preserved the fundamentals of openings.

[]{#_Toc210218244 .anchor}Congruent Rule : **An advancement rectangle is
composed of two adjacent advancement squares.**

The fact that lines in 2D are independent leads to the
invariant[]{.indexref
entry="invariant:A pattern which remains constant while other things change."}
that advancement manifolds should be independent. Thus, lines are
independent in 2D, planes are independent in 3D, and cubes would be
independent in 4D.

[]{#_Toc210218245 .anchor}Congruent Rule : **A linear move**[]{.indexref
entry="linear move:A move along end tiles, blocked by advancement rectangle(s)."}
**is legal if at least one advancement rectangle**[]{.indexref
entry="advancement rectangle:The advancement manifold for a linear move, both quadrants."}
**is empty.**

A classic invariant[]{.indexref
entry="invariant:A pattern which remains constant while other things change."}
in physics is "what is not forbidden is allowed." So, if a linear
move[]{.indexref
entry="linear move:A move along end tiles, blocked by advancement rectangle(s)."}
is unblocked in two planes, it is advancing in both
planes.[]{#_Ref59563349 .anchor}

Congruent Rule : **A linear move**[]{.indexref
entry="linear move:A move along end tiles, blocked by advancement rectangle(s)."}
**occurs in every unblocked plane that intersect along it.**

### Visualizing the Planes

In 2D, the two base pieces (rook & bishop) move in *two* types of
*lines*; orthogonal for the rook and diagonal for the bishop, while the
number of lines for each piece is precisely two. This is now such a
familiar concept that we may have forgotten that mastering the diagonal
move of the bishop took a little more effort than mastering the
orthogonal move of the rook. For instance, there are two names for
orthogonal lines, horizontal and vertical (or for the purist, rank and
file) but only one name for the diagonal lines. The terms *diagonal* and
*slant* would almost have made good candidates, but which direction was
which pretty much put the kibosh on that idea.

In 3D, the three base pieces (rook, bishop & duke) move in *three* types
of *planes*, but the number of planes for each piece is now *more than
two* and, surprise, *no longer constant*. It will prove very useful to
identify and name these planes, as well as provide the Intrepid Reader
with a visualization of them which can be internalized.

Figure 16 shows all thirteen planes. The 3D board is shown as a
wire-framed cube. All left/right designators in this figure are from the
perspective of the right vertical edge (White's perspective).

There are 3 *orthogonal* planes (rook); horizontal, left vertical, and
right vertical (a). There are 4 *skew* planes (bishop): upward,
downward, leftward, and rightward (b). Note their hexagonal shape. The
first pair are the *forward planes*, the second pair the *outward
planes.* There are 6 *slant* planes (duke) which come in pairs called
*cross planes*; the major & minor, the upleft & downleft, and the
upright & downright.

Up and down designators imply the plane tilts toward the opponent in
that direction.

![[]{#_Ref96173323 .anchor}Figure 16: The 13 Planes of 3D
Chess](media/image17.png){alt="A picture containing background pattern Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="6.223611111111111in"}

There are three types of planes in 3D chess. *Orthogonal* for the rook
(3); *horizontal*, *left vertical*, and *right vertical* (a). *Skew* for
the bishop (4); *upward*, *downward*, *leftward*, and *rightward* (b).
*Slant* for the duke (6): the *major* & *minor* cross pairs, the
*upleft* & *downleft* cross pairs, and the *upright* & *downright* cross
pairs (c). All left and right designators are from each players'
perspective. Up and down designators indicate in which direction the
plane approaches the opponent. Except for the horizontal, major, and
minor planes, these designators are swapped between Black and White
(shown). From the neutral point of view of this figure the duke minor
plane is edge on; it has been rotated ever so slightly to make it
visible.

### Definitions

It is useful to label some of the tiles in an advancement square. An
[]{#apex_tile .anchor}*apex*[]{.indexref
entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."}
*tile*[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
is one diagonally opposed to the source tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}.
The line of apex tiles divides an advancement square into two triangular
regions. An []{#end_tile .anchor}e*nd tile* lies down the inner edges of
an advancement square. A linear move will always be to an end tile. A
quadrant move may or may not end up on the apex tile, but it is more or
less headed in that direction.

Recall that the outer pair of edges of an advancement square is called
the perimeter, and that the last end tiles are both on the perimeter and
on the inner pair of edges.

### Impact

There are several ways to measure the *impact*[]{.indexref
entry="impact:Measures of a pieceâs ability to affect the game; range, PPR, & stab."}
of a piece.

The *range*[]{.indexref
entry="range:What percentage of the board a piece can eventually reach."}
of a piece is what percentage of the board it can *eventually* reach. In
2D, the rook's range[]{.indexref
entry="range:What percentage of the board a piece can eventually reach."}
is 100%, the bishop's only 50%, and the duke's is 25%. All can reach any
tile in its range[]{.indexref
entry="range:What percentage of the board a piece can eventually reach."}
on an empty board in just two moves. The knight also has a
range[]{.indexref
entry="range:What percentage of the board a piece can eventually reach."}
of 100% but it can take many moves to reach an arbitrary tile.

[]{#power_projection .anchor}*Power projection*[]{.indexref
entry="Power projection:The percentage of tiles a piece can reach in one move."}
is the number of tiles a piece can reach in *one* move. The power
projection ratio (*PPR*[]{.indexref
entry="PPR:Power projection ratio, portion of the board reachable in 1 move."})
is the *percentage* of tiles a piece can reach in one move.

The *STAB* value was the number of pieces that could be covered
*simultaneously*.

### Presentation

Advancement squares are fundamental to defining the legality of a move.
To help visualize them the tiles within will be indicated with a variety
of *decorators*, colored diamonds that just fit inside a tile.
Decorators come in a variety of types and colors, one color for each
piece (such as red for rook), one type for each kind of tile (edge,
apex, body, etc.). For instance, edge tiles will have a dark diamond in
the center of the decorator, while apex tiles will have a hollow diamond
in the center, and body tiles will be unadorned.

### Structure

In the chapters to follow, the movement rules for each piece will be
presented. For the base pieces, look for the type of plane it moves in,
how many planes it can move in, how many quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}
are in each plane, and how the perimeters grow. The planes,
quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."},
and perimeters are all consequences of the type of rays that govern a
piece's move. For the derived pieces, look for how the base pieces are
combined and constrained.

Because the rook was our paradigm guide, the next section duplicates
some of the information presented in Chapter 1. The duplication will be
tolerated because it affords three benefits.

- keeps all move rules in one place, eases comparing different moves

- continues to accumulate the conjugate rules of chess without
  duplication

- introduces additional decorators for the advancement squares

- eases comparison of sub sections between the individual piece chapters

## Rook

From the discovery[]{.indexref
entry="discovery:Rules to 3D chess must be discovered, not invented."}
perspective the rook is the most fundamental piece on the board as it is
tied to the topology of the board in the simplest possible way. It is
first amongst the base pieces, it has the easiest move to visualize, the
clearest to present, and it just served as the point of the paradigm
spear in penetrating the trajectory[]{.indexref
entry="trajectory:A unique path (a sequence of tiles) from one tile to another."}
paradigm.

### Face Rays

The rook advances along rays which change *one* coordinate. In 2D, it
advances along a *single* side ray[]{.indexref
entry="side ray:Unit length ray that points to adjacent square through a side."}.
In 3D, it advances along a *pair* of face rays. A rook linear
move[]{.indexref
entry="linear move:A move along end tiles, blocked by advancement rectangle(s)."}
will thus define a growing line which changes one coordinate and a rook
quadrant move[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant move:A move into a quadrant, blocking is by an advancement square."}
will define a growing square which changes two coordinates.

### Range {#range-1}

Because the rook advances along rays which change only one coordinate,
it can reach *every* tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
on the board but because it moves in one dimension less than the board,
it can still get to each tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
it can reach in just *two* moves, same as in 2D.

[]{#_Toc210218247 .anchor}Congruent Rule : **The rook can reach all the
tiles on the board.**

### Three Orthogonal Planes

In 2D, the board is a square, with sides and corners. Since the rook
advances along side rays, it moves in two *orthogonal lines*. An
orthogonal line[]{.indexref
entry="orthogonal line:The space a 2D rookâs straight-line moves occur in."}
separates opposite *sides* of the board; thus 4 sides in 2 pairs implies
2 lines.

In 3D, the board is a cube, with faces, edges, and corners. Since the
rook advances along face rays, it moves in *orthogonal* *planes*. An
orthogonal plane[]{.indexref
entry="orthogonal plane:The space a 3D rookâs planar moves occur in."}
separates opposite *faces* of the board; thus 6 faces in 3 pairs implies
*three* planes.

The rook moves in three orthogonal planes; one []{#horizontal_plane
.anchor}*horizontal plane*[]{.indexref
entry="horizontal plane:Rook plane that is horizontal (a level, constant Z-axis)."},
and two vertical planes (the []{#left_plane .anchor}*left vertical
plane*[]{.indexref
entry="left plane:Rook plane that is vertical (constant Y-axis)."} and
the []{#right_plane .anchor}*right vertical plane*[]{.indexref
entry="right plane:Rook plane that is vertical (constant X-axis)."}).
From either player's point of view, envision sticking your left arm into
the left face of the board, palm vertical; there's the left
plane[]{.indexref
entry="left plane:Rook plane that is vertical (constant Y-axis)."}.
Similarly, envision sticking your right arm into the right face of the
board, palm vertical; there's the right plane[]{.indexref
entry="right plane:Rook plane that is vertical (constant X-axis)."}. See
Figure 19.

### Four Quadrants

A rook plane is cut by *two* straight lines connecting adjacent cubes
(tiles) by their faces. Thus, a rook plane has *four*
quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}.

Figure 17 shows the tiles a rook can cover in a single *orthogonal*
plane[]{.indexref
entry="orthogonal plane:The space a 3D rookâs planar moves occur in."},
the horizontal one. Note that it covers all of them. The two straight
lines are shown with dark diamond decorators; this clearly shows the
four quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}.
The shape of an orthogonal plane[]{.indexref
entry="orthogonal plane:The space a 3D rookâs planar moves occur in."}
is always an 8x8 square, independent of the location of the rook, just
as the orthogonal lines in 2D were always 8 tiles long and independent
of the rook's location. Orthogonal planes connect four faces of the
board. See Figure 16.

![[]{#_Ref60737006 .anchor}Figure 17: Rook's Plane is Cut by Two Lines,
Thus Four
Quadrants](media/image18.tiff){alt="A picture containing checker Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="1.0333333333333334in"}

A rook plane is cut by 2 lines yielding 4 quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}.
The black decorators are used to indicate the 4 rays that originate from
the rook on KR5,4. The shape of an orthogonal plane[]{.indexref
entry="orthogonal plane:The space a 3D rookâs planar moves occur in."}
is always an 8x8 square, independent of the rook's position.

### Opposing Quadrants

Figure 18 shows the rook quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}
in opposing pairs for clarity. The ghost rooks indicate legal moves to
those perimeters. It will become useful to distinguish between
[]{#pure_quadrant .anchor}*pure quadrant*[]{.indexref
entry="pure quadrant:Quadrant move which does not include the end tiles."}
moves and []{#full_quadrant .anchor}*full quadrant*[]{.indexref
entry="full quadrant:Quadrant move which does include the end tiles."}
moves; full quadrant[]{.indexref
entry="full quadrant:Quadrant move which does include the end tiles."}
moves include the end tiles.

![[]{#_Ref60737359 .anchor}Figure 18: Rook Opposing Quadrants in
Horizontal
Plane](media/image19.png){alt="A picture containing text, gambling house, checker Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="2.2916666666666665in"}

Each plane of the rook move contains four quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}.
Advancement squares of various sizes are shown for the horizontal
plane[]{.indexref
entry="horizontal plane:Rook plane that is horizontal (a level, constant Z-axis)."}
in opposing quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}
for clarity. A 3x3 and a 4x4 advancement square are shown in (a) and a
2x2 and a 6x6 advancement square (extends off board) are shown in (b).
The []{#single_ghosted .anchor}*single ghosted*[]{.indexref
entry="single ghosted:Pieces on non-end tiles of a perimeter (pure quadrant moves)."}
rooks show the locations where the rook can make pure
quadrant[]{.indexref
entry="pure quadrant:Quadrant move which does not include the end tiles."}
moves (60% opacity)[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant moves:A move into a quadrant, blocking is by an advancement square."}.
The end tiles contain []{#double_ghosted .anchor}*double
ghosted*[]{.indexref
entry="double ghosted:Pieces on the end tiles of a perimeter (full quadrant/linear moves)."}
rooks (30% opacity); including them implies a full quadrant move. Moves
to end tiles are linear moves, not quadrant moves[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant moves:A move into a quadrant, blocking is by an advancement square."},
and require at least one advancement rectangle[]{.indexref
entry="advancement rectangle:The advancement manifold for a linear move, both quadrants."}
to be unblocked.

### 2D Projection of the 3D Move

Figure 19 shows the three planes of the rook (b). The straight-line
moves are indicated with dark diamond decorators, they indicate the face
rays. Each line (two face rays in opposite directions) is the
intersection of two planes. The orthogonal lines of the rook's 2D move
are shown for comparison (a). Note that projection of the 3D rook's
planar move onto a two-dimensional surface is just the 2D move.

![Shape Description automatically generated with medium
confidence](media/image20.png){width="6.5in"
height="7.5256944444444445in"}

[]{#_Ref59533252 .anchor}Figure 19: Rook's Three Orthogonal Planes

The 2D rook moves in two orthogonal *lines* (a). The 3D rook moves in
three orthogonal *planes* (b). Planes intersect at the straight-line
moves (black diamond inserts). Projection of the 3D rook move onto any
face of the 3D board is the 2D rook move.

Invariants can apply between abstraction levels, not just within them.
One way to validate the rules of 3D chess is to check if a projection of
the 3D move onto a two-dimensional surface yields the 2D move. Note that
the projection of the 3D rook's planar move[]{.indexref
entry="planar move:A move without a trajectory in a plane which cuts a 3D board."}
on a face of the 3D board is just the 2D rook's move. The face of a cube
is a two-dimensional space.

[]{#_Toc210218248 .anchor}Congruent Rule : **Projection of the 3D rook
move onto two dimensions yields the 2D move.**

### Quadrant Move Snapshots

Figure 20 shows a series of snapshots of the rook's advancement
square[]{.indexref
entry="advancement square:An NxN advancement manifold, must be empty for a legal move."}
as it advances into the upper quadrant of the horizontal
plane[]{.indexref
entry="horizontal plane:Rook plane that is horizontal (a level, constant Z-axis)."}.
In this figure, a new diamond decorator is used, but first a definition.
An *apex*[]{.indexref
entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."}
*tile*[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
is one diagonally opposed to the source tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}.
An open black diamond decorator is used to indicate an apex[]{.indexref
entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."}
tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}.
This figure shows the sequence of apex[]{.indexref
entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."}
tiles in each snapshot. Having a decorator for the apex[]{.indexref
entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."}
tiles becomes more and more useful as each new base piece[]{.indexref
entry="base piece:A piece which moves along only 1 type of ray; rook, bishop, duke."}
is considered, so it is introduced now to establish familiarity. As
before, straight-line moves (the rays) are indicated with solid black
diamond decorators, the growing tip of which will be called an *end*
*tile*[]{.indexref
entry="end tile:The tiles down the inner edges of an advancement square."}.
They are conceptual cousins to apex[]{.indexref
entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."}
tiles. Also, as before, an unadorned diamond indicates an interior
tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
of no special significance.

Note that capture does require a piece to move to the one specific
tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
which is occupied. A rule to allow capture of all pieces on a
perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} by
moving to any tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
on the perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} is
impossible to defend; there go the gambits, so it was summarily
rejected.

Obviously, a piece may not advance past another piece, just like it may
not in 2D.

An advancement square[]{.indexref
entry="advancement square:An NxN advancement manifold, must be empty for a legal move."}
may extend off the board. In the case of a rook, it leaves a rectangular
shape behind. If any part of a rook's advancement square[]{.indexref
entry="advancement square:An NxN advancement manifold, must be empty for a legal move."}
extends off the board, so does its apex[]{.indexref
entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."}
tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}.
The off-board tiles have no effect on a pieces' moves (they count as
empty tiles) and of course the piece may not move to them.

The next three figures show the rook quadrant and linear moves in a
variety of contexts. Some of this should sound familiar as it was
previously introduced in the first chapter (the paradigm chapter).

![[]{#_Ref59131314 .anchor}Figure 20: Rook Snapshots of a Quadrant Move
in a Horizontal
Plane](media/image21.png){alt="Diagram Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="6.055555555555555in"}

A series of 5 snapshots (a) -- (e) showing each new
perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} of the
6x6 advancement square[]{.indexref
entry="advancement square:An NxN advancement manifold, must be empty for a legal move."}
which must be empty of any other pieces for the rook to be able to
advance to perimeter 5 (e). Each perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} is two
tiles larger than the previous one (3, 5, 7, 9, 11). Decorated red
diamonds indicate tactically significant aspects of advancement squares;
the line of solid black decorators represents the two rays, the open
black decorators the sequence of apex[]{.indexref
entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."}
tiles. Undecorated tiles (pure red tiles) indicate uninteresting
interior tiles. All highlight diamonds are slightly smaller (very
slightly) than a tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
so the underlying tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}'s
color (black or white) can peek through. (Zooming on supported platforms
makes this more useful.)

Figure 21 shows three snapshots of the rook's quadrant advance in a left
vertical plane (*left plane*[]{.indexref
entry="left plane:Rook plane that is vertical (constant Y-axis)."}). In
this example, the advancement square[]{.indexref
entry="advancement square:An NxN advancement manifold, must be empty for a legal move."}
extends off the board leaving a rectangular shape behind, which should
not be confused with an advancement rectangle[]{.indexref
entry="advancement rectangle:The advancement manifold for a linear move, both quadrants."};
that's for linear moves. The lightly ghosted rooks indicate which tiles
on the successive perimeters are unblocked *pure* quadrant[]{.indexref
entry="pure quadrant:Quadrant move which does not include the end tiles."}
moves[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant moves:A move into a quadrant, blocking is by an advancement square."},
the heavily ghosted rooks are all on end tiles (*full* quadrant moves)
and remind us that they are actually linear moves (the adjacent
advancement square for them has been suppressed). Rooks may make pure
quadrant moves or linear moves, but not full quadrant moves. This can be
a little confusing at this stage of development, but the distinction
between pure and full becomes relevant for the pawn and very relevant
when the discussion turns to blocking.

Hang in there.

decorators.

### Linear Move Snapshots

Figure 22 shows three snapshots of a linear advance blocked in both
planes by the king. For clarity, only the horizontal plane[]{.indexref
entry="horizontal plane:Rook plane that is horizontal (a level, constant Z-axis)."}
is shown. Note there are now two diagonal lines of apex decorators: one
for each quadrant. These quadrants share the linear move and together
form the advancement rectangle.

In addition, a new decorator is added. It consists of a pair of
side-by-side solid black diamonds and is used to indicate the tiles of a
linear move[]{.indexref
entry="linear move:A move along end tiles, blocked by advancement rectangle(s)."}
(the shared end tiles of each quadrant). It is a conceptual cousin to
the decorator for apex[]{.indexref
entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."}
tiles.

![[]{#_Ref60067870 .anchor}Figure 22: Rook Snapshots of Linear Move in

Three snapshots (a) -- (c) of a rook making a linear move[]{.indexref
entry="linear move:A move along end tiles, blocked by advancement rectangle(s)."}
are shown in the horizontal plane[]{.indexref
entry="horizontal plane:Rook plane that is horizontal (a level, constant Z-axis)."}
only. Because the king is in the direct[]{.indexref
entry="direct:Linear moves with two virtual quadrants reduce to a single end tile."}
line of this move, it blocks both planes (vertical plane not shown).
Note the use of the new two black diamond decorator to indicate the
sequence of end tiles along which a linear move[]{.indexref
entry="linear move:A move along end tiles, blocked by advancement rectangle(s)."}
occurs.

### Linear Move in Two Planes

To achieve a full and complete understanding of linear moves, it is
necessary to see them in both planes simultaneously. Figure 23 shows a
linear move[]{.indexref
entry="linear move:A move along end tiles, blocked by advancement rectangle(s)."}
for the rook which at first appears to have the Black king in check, as
the king is in a straight line[]{.indexref
entry="straight line:Orthogonal (rook), diagonal (bishop)."} from the
rook. However, both advancement rectangles are blocked, and furthermore
are blocked at different perimeters. The right vertical
plane[]{.indexref
entry="right plane:Rook plane that is vertical (constant X-axis)."} is
blocked by the knight to a 3x3 advancement square[]{.indexref
entry="advancement square:An NxN advancement manifold, must be empty for a legal move."}
while the horizontal plane[]{.indexref
entry="horizontal plane:Rook plane that is horizontal (a level, constant Z-axis)."}
is blocked by the bishop to a 5x5 advancement square[]{.indexref
entry="advancement square:An NxN advancement manifold, must be empty for a legal move."}.
(This implies a 5x9 advancement rectangle[]{.indexref
entry="advancement rectangle:The advancement manifold for a linear move, both quadrants."}
which of necessity extends off the board.)

Note the half stack in the White tray, since the bishop is on the board,
but the duke is not.

Another decorator is now introduced, the offset single solid black
diamond decorator. It is just the double diamond decorator with one of
the two black diamonds removed. It indicates that this linear
move[]{.indexref
entry="linear move:A move along end tiles, blocked by advancement rectangle(s)."}
is now occurring in *one plane only*. Call this *polarization*.

![[]{#_Ref60068636 .anchor}Figure 23: Rook Linear Move in Two

Rook makes a linear move[]{.indexref
entry="linear move:A move along end tiles, blocked by advancement rectangle(s)."}
to the ghost rook location but falls short of putting the king in check.
The two quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}
in each plane form the pair of advancement rectangles, one of which must
be unblocked for the linear move[]{.indexref
entry="linear move:A move along end tiles, blocked by advancement rectangle(s)."}
to be legal. They can be, and typically are, blocked at different
distances, as shown here. The vertical plane is blocked by the knight to
a 3x5 advancement rectangle[]{.indexref
entry="advancement rectangle:The advancement manifold for a linear move, both quadrants."},
while the horizontal plane[]{.indexref
entry="horizontal plane:Rook plane that is horizontal (a level, constant Z-axis)."}
is blocked by the bishop to a 5x9 advancement rectangle[]{.indexref
entry="advancement rectangle:The advancement manifold for a linear move, both quadrants."}
(which of necessity extends off the board). Note that the end
tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
of the linear move[]{.indexref
entry="linear move:A move along end tiles, blocked by advancement rectangle(s)."}
at perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} 3 has a
single black diamond decorator. This decorator shows that the linear
move[]{.indexref
entry="linear move:A move along end tiles, blocked by advancement rectangle(s)."}
is now unblocked in only plane. Note also that the apex[]{.indexref
entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."}
decorator has been added to all four quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}.

### Shape

Let us now show how the design of the rook alludes to how it moves.

Figure 24 shows a rook in the corner of the board and marks out all the
tiles it can get to in a single move. They outline three sides of a
cube. Thus, the rook is a cube, just elongated for style (which
conveniently matches the visual of the board anyway).

![[]{#_Ref58940810 .anchor}Figure 24: Rook
Shape](media/image25.png){alt="Shape Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="6.111805555555556in"}

From the corner of the board the rook's move outlines a cube, elongated
on a physical board. Thus, the shape chosen for the rook is an elongated
cube and alludes to its move.

### Power Projection

From the corner of the board, the rook covers 147 tiles via quadrant
move (of which 21 are apex[]{.indexref
entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."}
tiles), and 21 tiles via linear move, for a total of 168 tiles. Power
projection[]{.indexref
entry="Power projection:The percentage of tiles a piece can reach in one move."}
is 168/511 = 32.9% compared to 14/63 = 22.2% in 2D. The power projection
ratio ([]{#PPR .anchor}PPR[]{.indexref
entry="PPR:Power projection ratio, portion of the board reachable in 1 move."})[]{.indexref
entry="Power projection:The percentage of tiles a piece can reach in one move."}
for the rook is position independent, just like in 2D. The debunked
straight-line move[]{.indexref
entry="straight-line move:A move in a straight line which cuts a 2D board."}
would have been 21/511 = 4.11%; woefully inadequate -- *feels like
chess*[]{.indexref
entry="feels like chess:Play in 3D must feel like chess, a one pawn advantage wins."}*.*

### Review

A lot has been asked of the reader in this chapter. The concepts and
terminology will be a continuing aid in understanding the rest of the
pieces. However, as each new piece is introduced additional nuances
appear. If you have the rook down well then you are in good shape for
grasping what comes next.

Some jargon to recall; face rays, orthogonal planes[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."},
quadrant moves[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant moves:A move into a quadrant, blocking is by an advancement square."}
versus linear moves, advancement squares and advancement rectangles,
perimeters, apex tiles[]{.indexref
entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."}, end
tiles, and linear tiles, diamond tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
decorators (open, closed, double, offset single), and congruent
rules[]{.indexref
entry="congruent rules:Rules for chess which are dimension agnostic."}.
The three planes of the rook are the horizontal, left vertical, and
right vertical, each with four quadrants.

As a reminder, all these terms have been captured in the Jargon Table of
Appendix III.

## Bishop

The bishop is the second simplest base piece[]{.indexref
entry="base piece:A piece which moves along only 1 type of ray; rook, bishop, duke."}.
It moves differently than the rook; diagonally in 2D, along a different
kind of plane in 3D. In 3D, all base pieces have both quadrant moves and
linear moves. If the rook revealed the paradigm barrier that separates
2D and 3D chess, then the bishop cements the planar move[]{.indexref
entry="planar move:A move without a trajectory in a plane which cuts a 3D board."},
but delightfully, it also reveals unexpected nuances. Paradigms are the
great revealer, and the bishop provides additional epiphanies about what
it means to *move in a plane*. We'll take our time getting to know the
bishop and build our knowledge and intuition figure by figure.

### Edge Rays

The bishop advances along rays which change *two* coordinates. In 2D, it
advances along a *single* corner ray[]{.indexref
entry="corner ray:Unit length ray that points to adjacent square through a corner."}.
In 3D, it advances along a *pair* of edge rays[]{.indexref
entry="edge ray:Unit length ray that points to adjacent cube through an edge."}.
A bishop linear move[]{.indexref
entry="linear move:A move along end tiles, blocked by advancement rectangle(s)."}
will thus define a line which changes two coordinates (one more than the
rook) and a bishop quadrant move[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant move:A move into a quadrant, blocking is by an advancement square."}
will define a perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} which
changes all three coordinates (one more than the rook).

### Range[]{.indexref entry="Range:What percentage of the board a piece can eventually reach."} {#range-2}

Because the bishop advances along rays which change two coordinates, it
can reach only *half* the tiles on the board, (half as many as the
rook), but because it moves in one dimension less than the board, it can
still get to each tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
it can reach in just *two* moves, same as in 2D; (32 versus 256).

[]{#_Toc210218249 .anchor}Congruent Rule : **The bishop can reach half
the tiles on the board.**

### Four Skew Planes

In 2D, the board is a square, with sides and corners. Since the bishop
advances along corner rays, it moves in two *diagonal* *lines*. A
diagonal line separates opposite *corners* of the board; thus 4 corners
in 2 pairs implies 2 lines.

In 3D, the board is a cube, with faces, edges, and corners. Since the
bishop advances along edge rays[]{.indexref
entry="edge ray:Unit length ray that points to adjacent cube through an edge."},
it moves in []{#skew_planes .anchor}*skew* *planes*.[]{.indexref
entry="skew plane:Plane a bishop moves in, separates opposite corners of the board."}
A skew plane[]{.indexref
entry="skew plane:Plane a bishop moves in, separates opposite corners of the board."}
separates opposite *corners* of the board; thus 8 corners in 4 pairs
implies *four* planes. This is the first unexpected difference from the
rook; four planes instead of three.

Skew planes come in pairs; two which lean between the players, called
[]{#forward_planes .anchor}*forward planes*, and two which lean
outwards, called []{#outward_planes .anchor}*outward planes*. The
intersection of each pair of planes occurs along a single diagonal line
connecting tiles by their edges.

The skew planes of the bishop are more difficult to visualize than the
orthogonal planes of the rook; it is going to require additional figures
to clarify the bishop move.

The next two figures show the bishop's skew planes in pairs. Figure 25
shows the forward planes. Each player regards the plane which leans
toward the opponent as the up-forward plane[]{.indexref
entry="forward plane:The two bishop planes that lean toward the opponent."}
([]{#upward_plane .anchor}*upward plane*[]{.indexref
entry="upward plane:Bishop plane that approaches the opponent in the up direction."}
for short) and regards the plane which leans toward them as the
down-forward plane[]{.indexref
entry="forward plane:The two bishop planes that lean toward the opponent."}
([]{#downward_plane .anchor}*downward plane*[]{.indexref
entry="downward plane:Bishop plane that approaches the opponent in the down direction."}
for short). This means that White's upward plane[]{.indexref
entry="upward plane:Bishop plane that approaches the opponent in the up direction."}
is Black's downward plane[]{.indexref
entry="downward plane:Bishop plane that approaches the opponent in the down direction."},
and vice-a-versa.

![[]{#_Ref60758544 .anchor}Figure 25: Bishop Forward
Planes](media/image26.png){alt="Shape Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="6.111805555555556in"}

The two *forward planes* for a bishop in the center of the board (K5,4)
are shown. The three straight lines in each plane are indicated with
black diamond decorators (apex[]{.indexref
entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."}
tiles have been suppressed for clarity). These two planes intersect in a
diagonal line perpendicular to the two players. As in 2D the bishop is
confined to the color of the tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
it starts on.

Figure 26 shows the outward planes. The outward plane[]{.indexref
entry="outward plane:The two bishop planes that lean outwards."} that
leans to the right is called the right outward plane[]{.indexref
entry="outward plane:The two bishop planes that lean outwards."}
([]{#rightward_plane .anchor}*rightward plane*[]{.indexref
entry="rightward plane:Bishop plane that in the up direction leans outward to the right."}),
and the outward plane[]{.indexref
entry="outward plane:The two bishop planes that lean outwards."} that
leans to the left is called the left outward plane[]{.indexref
entry="outward plane:The two bishop planes that lean outwards."}
([]{#leftward_plane .anchor}*leftward plane*[]{.indexref
entry="leftward plane:Bishop plane that in the up direction leans outward to the left."}).
As for the forward planes, White's rightward plane[]{.indexref
entry="rightward plane:Bishop plane that in the up direction leans outward to the right."}
is Black's leftward plane[]{.indexref
entry="leftward plane:Bishop plane that in the up direction leans outward to the left."},
and vice-a-versa.

![[]{#_Ref60758567 .anchor}Figure 26: Bishop Outward
Planes](media/image27.png){alt="Shape Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="6.111805555555556in"}

The two *outward planes* for a bishop in the center of the board (K5,4)
are shown. The three straight lines in each plane are shown with black
diamond decorators (apex[]{.indexref
entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."}
tiles have been suppressed for clarity). These two planes intersect in a
diagonal line which extends between the players.

It is not so easy to visualize all four bishop planes at once as it was
to visualize all three rook planes at once.

The size and shape of a skew plane[]{.indexref
entry="skew plane:Plane a bishop moves in, separates opposite corners of the board."}
depends on the location of the bishop, just as the length of the two
diagonal lines in 2D depend on its location. However, in 3D, both the
size and the shape can vary. When in the center of the board, the shape
of any of the four planes is an irregular hexagon. As the bishop
approaches the outer limits of the board, some of these planes become
equilateral triangles, until at the extreme limit of the corner, three
are triangular, and one appears to be missing (it is the single
tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
the bishop is on).

In 2D, the maximum extents occur when the bishop is in the center of the
board, while at the corner one line appears to disappear (again, it is
just one tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
long, consisting of just the tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
the bishop is on). In 3D, the same phenomenon occurs, but now with the
added wrinkle that not only does the size of the bishop's manifold
change, but so does its shape.

Figure 27 shows the four bishop planes inside a cubical wireframe of the
3D chess board that is better proportioned than the level view.

![[]{#_Ref96340630 .anchor}Figure 27: The Four Skew Planes of the
Bishop](media/image28.png){alt="A picture containing text, table, worktable, window Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="1.2583333333333333in"}

Shown are the four skew planes of the bishop inside a cubical wire fame
rendition of the 3D chess board. *Upward* and *downward* are the
*forward* planes, *leftward* and *rightward* are the *outward* planes.
Names are from White's perspective (right vertical edge).

### Six Quadrants

Surprisingly, a bishop plane is cut by *three straight lines,* rather
than the two in the rook's orthogonal planes, so instead of four
quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."},
there are *six quadrants*[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}.[^16]
This is the second unexpected difference from the rook.

Figure 28 shows the tiles a bishop can reach in a single *skew*
plane[]{.indexref
entry="skew plane:Plane a bishop moves in, separates opposite corners of the board."},
an outward plane[]{.indexref
entry="outward plane:The two bishop planes that lean outwards."}, the
right one from White's point of view (rightward). Note that it can reach
all of the tiles in this plane, all of which are white. The three
straight lines are shown with dark diamond decorators; this clearly
shows the six quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}.
Skew planes connect either three edges of the board (triangle shape) or
six edges as shown here (hexagonal shape).

![[]{#_Ref60758628 .anchor}Figure 28: Bishop Plane is Cut by Three
Lines, thus Six
Quadrants](media/image29.png){alt="Shape, background pattern Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="6.111805555555556in"}

A bishop plane is cut by 3 lines yielding 6 quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}.
The black decorators are used to indicate the 6 rays that originate from
the bishop on K4,5. The shape of a skew plane[]{.indexref
entry="skew plane:Plane a bishop moves in, separates opposite corners of the board."}
can be either an irregular hexagon (as in this figure) or an equilateral
triangle, it depends on the position of the bishop.

### Opposing Quadrants

In order to make the six quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}
of the bishop move a little clearer, the next two figures show
alternating quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}
for White's rightward plane[]{.indexref
entry="rightward plane:Bishop plane that in the up direction leans outward to the right."}.
For no particular reason, the first set is called the odd
quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}
and the second set the even quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}.

![[]{#_Toc62302686 .anchor}Figure 29: Bishop Alternating Quadrants in
Right Outward Plane (1, 3,
5)](media/image30.png){alt="Shape Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="6.111805555555556in"}

Three alternating quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}
in White's rightward plane[]{.indexref
entry="rightward plane:Bishop plane that in the up direction leans outward to the right."}
are shown (K3,4). Starting at the top and advancing clockwise the
advancement squares are of size 2x2, 3x3 and 4x4. Ghost bishops indicate
where on the perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} of
these three advancement squares the bishop can advance to as a pure
quadrant move[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant move:A move into a quadrant, blocking is by an advancement square."},
double ghosted as a full quadrant move (the end tiles).

Note how quickly the advancement squares extend off the board. In every
case, the apex[]{.indexref
entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."}
tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
is the first to leave the board. As for the rook, a bishop may not move
off the board and tiles off the board do not block[]{.indexref
entry="block:Blocks cover, prevents a piece from moving to a desired location."}
a move.

In both figures, the pair of up and down quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}
look different than the four side-to-side quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}.
This is an artifact of the board not being cubicle in its level-by-level
presentation. Therefore, unfortunately, it takes a little practice to
visualize bishop quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}
without a perceptual bias. On a truly cubical board this bias
evaporates.

![[]{#_Toc62302687 .anchor}Figure 30: Bishop Alternating Quadrants in
Right Outward Plane (2, 4,
6)](media/image31.png){alt="Shape Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="6.111805555555556in"}

The other three alternating quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}
in White's rightward plane[]{.indexref
entry="rightward plane:Bishop plane that in the up direction leans outward to the right."}
are shown (K3,4). Starting at the right and advancing clockwise the
advancement squares are of size 2x2, 3x3 and 4x4. Ghost bishops indicate
where on the perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} of
these three advancement squares the bishop can advance to as a pure
quadrant move[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant move:A move into a quadrant, blocking is by an advancement square."},
double ghosted as a full quadrant move (the end tiles).

While the advancement squares are more diamond shaped than square
shaped, their perimeters grow by the same mathematical law as those for
the rook; (3, 5, 7, 9...).

### 2D Projection of the 3D Move

An important criterion for discovering the rules of 3D chess was the
principle that projecting a 3D move onto a 2D surface should yield the
2D move. Demonstrating this for the rook was trivial. Any pair of
intersecting rook planes projected the 2D rook move into all the other
planes perpendicular to the pair, all 7 of them. (Review Figure 19.)

Because the bishop moves in 4 planes, however, its case is more
intricate. Each of the 3 orthogonal planes intersecting at the location
of a bishop *directly* sport the two diagonal lines of the 2D bishop
move. For all the other orthogonal planes (7 horizontal, 7 left
vertical, and 7 right vertical) there are *four* lines, not two. There
are 6 ways to group these 4 lines by pairs; 4 pairs project the
*intersecting* diagonal lines of the 2D bishop, the other 2 pairs
project two *parallel* diagonal lines which don't intersect. In a sense,
a 3D bishop projects *two* 2D bishops.

For any *pair* of intersecting bishop planes, two of the three sets of
orthogonal planes show a single 2D bishop move; the other set shows two
*parallel* diagonal lines. There is a lot of symmetry and mathematical
beauty here, but, ahem, we shall leave the full appreciation of such to
the mathematicians. In adherence to the discovery principle, the bishop
planar move does in fact project the 2D move. Indeed, it does so even
better than the rook; given a pair of intersecting skew planes the
bishop projects the 2D move into 2/3 of the orthogonal planes, while for
a pair of intersecting orthogonal planes the rook projects the 2D move
into only 1/3 of them.

The bishop cross-plane pairs, the two forwards (upward and downward) and
the two outwards (leftward and rightward), project the 2D bishop move
only into the vertical orthogonal planes. Thus, it is easiest to see the
2D projection for one forward plane[]{.indexref
entry="forward plane:The two bishop planes that lean toward the opponent."}
and one outward plane[]{.indexref
entry="outward plane:The two bishop planes that lean outwards."}.

Figure 31 shows an example with the corresponding diagonal lines on a 2D
board.

The projections on the horizontal planes are easy to see. To help see
the projection in the right vertical planes, ghost bishops have been
used in the left most one (from White's point of view, on the left from
the neutral point of view). Note that the projection can imply a
*virtual* bishop; for instance, on the queen-rook level, the bishop
would be off the board, (what would be QR9,4).

The projection onto left vertical planes (White's point of view) yields
two parallel lines. They are indicated with yellow stars for the left
most left plane (right most right vertical plane for the neutral point
of view of these diagrams).

[]{#_Toc210218250 .anchor}Congruent Rule : **Projection of the 3D bishop
move onto two dimensions yields the 2D move.**

### Quadrant Move Snapshots

Figure 32 and Figure 33 show the four snapshots of a bishop making an
advance out to a 5x5 advancement square (perimeter 4)[]{.indexref
entry="rightward plane:Bishop plane that in the up direction leans outward to the right."}.
The empty piece trays on either side of the board should help in keeping
alignment from one snapshot to the next (a) -- (d). In each snapshot the
perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} grows
by two additional tiles (3, 5, 7, 9...). The inside edges of each
advancement square[]{.indexref
entry="advancement square:An NxN advancement manifold, must be empty for a legal move."}
(more of a rhombus shape for the bishop) are indicated with black
diamond decorators. Even though a bishop advancement square[]{.indexref
entry="advancement square:An NxN advancement manifold, must be empty for a legal move."}
is rhombus shaped, it still grows by the same mathematical law as for a
rook. The apex[]{.indexref
entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."}
tiles are indicated with hollow black diamond decorators. Ghost bishops
show the legal quadrant moves[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant moves:A move into a quadrant, blocking is by an advancement square."}
on each successive perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."}. Larger
advancement squares begin to extend off the board starting with the
apex[]{.indexref
entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."}
tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."},
so no ghost bishop at what would be QN*9*,5.

![[]{#_Ref59896065 .anchor}Figure 31: Bishop Projection of 3D Move onto
2D Orthogonal
Planes](media/image32.png){alt="Shape Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="7.33125in"}

Projection of the 3D bishop move is the 2D bishop move (a). One forward
and one outward plane project onto horizontal planes and vertical
planes, in this example the right vertical planes (b). Ghost bishops are
on the left most right vertical plane (White's point of view). On the
left vertical planes, the projection is two parallel lines, which are
marked with yellow stars in the outer left face of the board (all from
White's perspective).

![[]{#_Ref65490366 .anchor}Figure 32: Bishop Snapshots of Quadrant Move

Snapshots of White's bishop advancing into the lower forward quadrant of
the rightward plane[]{.indexref

from its home position (KR1,1) (a) -- (b). Black diamond decorators
indicate tiles on the inner edges of the advancement square[]{.indexref

The sequence of apex[]{.indexref

tiles is indicated with hollow black diamond decorators. Ghosted and
double ghosted bishops are on the respective perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} tiles
for these quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant moves:A move into a quadrant, blocking is by an advancement square."}.
The yellow rhombi highlight how the bishop move is a distorted
advancement square, but perimeters still grow by the same mathematical
law.

![[]{#_Ref65419130 .anchor}Figure 33: Bishop Snapshots of Quadrant Move
in a Rightward Plane (4x4 &

Continuation of previous figure; snapshots of White's bishop advancing
still further into the lower forward quadrant of the rightward
plane[^17][]{.indexref
entry="rightward plane:Bishop plane that in the up direction leans outward to the right."}
(c) -- (d). Ghosted and double ghosted bishops are on the respective
perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} tiles
for these quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant moves:A move into a quadrant, blocking is by an advancement square."}.
The yellow rhombi highlight how the bishop move is a distorted
advancement square, but perimeters still grow by the same mathematical
law. The empty piece trays on each side may help keep visual alignment
between the series of snapshots, particularly for such continuation
figures.

### Linear Move Snapshots

Figure 34 and Figure 35 show 3 snapshots of a bishop linear advance
(only one plane is shown).

![[]{#_Ref65490423 .anchor}Figure 34: Bishop Snapshots of Linear Move in
Rightward Plane (2x3 &
3x5)](media/image35.png){alt="Background pattern Description automatically generated with medium confidence"
width="6.5in" height="7.1097222222222225in"}

This (a) -- (b) and the next figure (c) show three snapshots of a bishop
linear move in the outward plane for White's white bishop (K2,1)
eventually advancing to K5,4. Only the rightward plane is shown. Note
that the rook (K6,5) will eventually block[]{.indexref
entry="block:Blocks cover, prevents a piece from moving to a desired location."}
advances in both planes.

Each advancement rectangle[]{.indexref
entry="advancement rectangle:The advancement manifold for a linear move, both quadrants."}
consists of the adjacent quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}.
The so-called advancement rectangle[]{.indexref
entry="advancement rectangle:The advancement manifold for a linear move, both quadrants."}
is hardly rectangular because of the rhombus shaped advancement squares.
Nonetheless, its perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} grows
by the same mathematical rule as for the rook's linear move[]{.indexref
entry="linear move:A move along end tiles, blocked by advancement rectangle(s)."};
5, 9, 13, etc.

![[]{#_Ref86395108 .anchor}Figure 35: Bishop Snapshots of Linear Move in
Rightward Plane
(4x7)](media/image36.png){alt="A picture containing shape Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="4.670833333333333in"}

This is the 3rd snapshot of a bishop making a linear advance from K2,1
ultimately blocked by the rook at K6,5 (c). Since it is in line with the
linear move, it blocks advance in both planes[]{.indexref
entry="linear move:A move along end tiles, blocked by advancement rectangle(s)."},
but for clarity only one plane is shown. As for the rook, the linear
move[]{.indexref
entry="linear move:A move along end tiles, blocked by advancement rectangle(s)."}
is indicated with double diamond decorators indicating that it is moving
in two planes. The so-called advancement rectangle[]{.indexref
entry="advancement rectangle:The advancement manifold for a linear move, both quadrants."}
of a bishop linear move[]{.indexref
entry="linear move:A move along end tiles, blocked by advancement rectangle(s)."}
is distorted because of the rhombus shape of its advancement squares.

Double diamond decorators are used to highlight the straight-line
sequence of tiles of linear moves. Any piece which lies along this
straight-line sequence will block[]{.indexref
entry="block:Blocks cover, prevents a piece from moving to a desired location."}
the move in both planes, as the rook does in this example. Apex tiles
help a bit in visualizing the rhombus shapes.

### Linear Move in Two Planes

Because the 3D board is biased towards levels, three examples of its
linear move[]{.indexref
entry="linear move:A move along end tiles, blocked by advancement rectangle(s)."}
will be provided. Figure 36 shows a linear move[]{.indexref
entry="linear move:A move along end tiles, blocked by advancement rectangle(s)."}
in both forward planes, Figure 37 shows a linear move[]{.indexref
entry="linear move:A move along end tiles, blocked by advancement rectangle(s)."}
in both outward planes, and Figure 38 shows a linear move[]{.indexref
entry="linear move:A move along end tiles, blocked by advancement rectangle(s)."}
in one forward and one outward plane[]{.indexref
entry="outward plane:The two bishop planes that lean outwards."}.

In all three cases, it at first appears that White has Black's king in
check, but this is not so as the king is on the perimeters[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} of two
5x9 advancement rectangles[]{.indexref
entry="advancement rectangle:The advancement manifold for a linear move, both quadrants."}
which is blocked in one plane by a knight at a 3x3 advancement
square[]{.indexref
entry="advancement square:An NxN advancement manifold, must be empty for a legal move."},
and in the other by a rook at a 4x4 advancement square[]{.indexref
entry="advancement square:An NxN advancement manifold, must be empty for a legal move."}.
The three situations are not rotations of each other but are otherwise
conceptually identical.

![[]{#_Ref60064883 .anchor}Figure 36: Bishop Linear Move in Two Forward
Planes](media/image37.png){alt="Shape Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="6.985416666666667in"}

At first glance it appears that White's bishop is putting Black's king
in check with a linear move[]{.indexref
entry="linear move:A move along end tiles, blocked by advancement rectangle(s)."}
along the forward planes (toward the viewer), but the king is on the
perimeters of four 5x5 advancement squares, paired up in two planes for
two 5x9 advancement rectangles. Since, the knight (KR level) blocks the
attack in the upward plane[]{.indexref
entry="upward plane:Bishop plane that approaches the opponent in the up direction."}
to a 3x3 advancement square[]{.indexref
entry="advancement square:An NxN advancement manifold, must be empty for a legal move."},
and the rook (QR level) blocks the attack in the downward
plane[]{.indexref
entry="downward plane:Bishop plane that approaches the opponent in the down direction."}
to a 4x4 advancement square[]{.indexref
entry="advancement square:An NxN advancement manifold, must be empty for a legal move."},
the king is not actually in check. Note the artwork trick where the king
and ghost bishop are offset sideways in the tiles, so both are visible.

![[]{#_Ref60064898 .anchor}Figure 37: Bishop Linear Move in Two Outward
Planes](media/image38.png){alt="Shape, arrow Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="6.985416666666667in"}

Same situation as in the previous figure, but with the linear
move[]{.indexref
entry="linear move:A move along end tiles, blocked by advancement rectangle(s)."}
along two outward planes; knight (KR level) blocks the attack in the
leftward plane[]{.indexref
entry="leftward plane:Bishop plane that in the up direction leans outward to the left."}
to a 3x3 advancement square[]{.indexref
entry="advancement square:An NxN advancement manifold, must be empty for a legal move."},
while the rook (QR level) blocks the attack in the rightward
plane[]{.indexref
entry="rightward plane:Bishop plane that in the up direction leans outward to the right."}
to a 4x4 advancement square[]{.indexref
entry="advancement square:An NxN advancement manifold, must be empty for a legal move."}.
The ghost bishop shows the farthest legal move the bishop can make in
this direction. The ghost bishop partially hides the offset diamond
decorator that indicates that the bishop at this point has been reduced
to traveling in only one plane. As before, the Black king is not
actually in check.

![[]{#_Ref60064908 .anchor}Figure 38: Bishop Linear Move in Forward and
Outward
Plane](media/image39.png){alt="Shape, arrow Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="6.985416666666667in"}

The bishop at first appears to have Black's king in check with a linear
move[]{.indexref
entry="linear move:A move along end tiles, blocked by advancement rectangle(s)."}
along the downward and rightward planes, but the king is just out of
reach. White's attack in the downward plane[]{.indexref
entry="downward plane:Bishop plane that approaches the opponent in the down direction."}
is blocked by the knight (KB level) to a 3x3 advancement
square[]{.indexref
entry="advancement square:An NxN advancement manifold, must be empty for a legal move."}
and in the rightward plane[]{.indexref
entry="rightward plane:Bishop plane that in the up direction leans outward to the right."}
its attack is blocked by the rook (Q level) to a 4x4 advancement
square[]{.indexref
entry="advancement square:An NxN advancement manifold, must be empty for a legal move."}.

### Shape

Figure 39 shows a bishop in the corner of the board and marks out all
the tiles it can get to in a single move. They outline three sides of a
tetrahedron. Therefore, the shape chosen for the bishop is a vertically
elongated tetrahedron.

![[]{#_Ref60066253 .anchor}Figure 39: Bishop
Shape](media/image40.png){alt="Shape Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="6.111805555555556in"}

From a corner of the board, the bishop can move in only three planes,
each with the shape of an equilateral triangle. The three triangles form
three sides of an equilateral tetrahedron. Thus, the shape chosen for
the bishop is an elongated tetrahedron and alludes to its move.

### Power Projection

From the corner of the board, the bishop covers 63 tiles via quadrant
move (of which 9 are apex[]{.indexref
entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."}
tiles), and 21 tiles via linear move, for a total of 84 tiles. Power
projection[]{.indexref
entry="Power projection:The percentage of tiles a piece can reach in one move."}
is 84/511 = 16.4% compared to 7/63 = 11.1% in 2D. Power
projection[]{.indexref
entry="Power projection:The percentage of tiles a piece can reach in one move."}
for the bishop is position dependent, it grows as the bishop approaches
the center of the board. The debunked straight-line move[]{.indexref
entry="straight-line move:A move in a straight line which cuts a 2D board."}
would have been 21/511 = 4.11%, way lower than for 2D -- *feels like
chess*[]{.indexref
entry="feels like chess:Play in 3D must feel like chess, a one pawn advantage wins."}*.*

From the center of the board; 2D is (7+6)/63 = 20.6%, 3D straight-line
is (6+7)\*3/511 = 7.63%. For the planar moves, for a bishop in one of

In every case, the power projection of the 3D planar move[]{.indexref

than the rook!

### Review

The 3D bishop is to the 3D rook, much like the 2D bishop is to the 2D
rook. Its move is governed by rays which change two coordinates; thus,
it moves in a different type of plane, and can reach only half the tiles
on the board. Like the 2D bishop it stays on whatever color it started
on. Like the rook it can get to any tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
it can reach in just two moves.

Some jargon to recall; edge rays[]{.indexref
entry="edge ray:Unit length ray that points to adjacent cube through an edge."},
skew planes, forward planes and outward planes, (upward & downward,
rightward & leftward), 4 planes each with 6 quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."};
all new. Then as for the rook; quadrant moves[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant moves:A move into a quadrant, blocking is by an advancement square."}
versus linear moves, advancement squares (rhombus shaped) and
advancement rectangles (double rhombi), perimeters, apex[]{.indexref
entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."}
tiles, end tiles and linear tiles, diamond tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
decorators (open, closed, double, offset single), and congruent
rules[]{.indexref
entry="congruent rules:Rules for chess which are dimension agnostic."}.

As a reminder, all these terms have been captured in the Jargon Table of
Appendix III.

## Duke {#duke-1}

The duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} is the
third base piece[]{.indexref
entry="base piece:A piece which moves along only 1 type of ray; rook, bishop, duke."}.
It is much to the bishop like the bishop is to the rook. As anticipated,
the duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} moves
differently than either the rook or the bishop, in a third kind of
plane, to which we have given the name *slant*. The duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} continues
to validate the concept of the planar move[]{.indexref
entry="planar move:A move without a trajectory in a plane which cuts a 3D board."},
but also reveals additional richness and subtlety. As with the bishop,
we'll take our time getting to know the duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} and build
our knowledge and intuition figure by figure.

### Corner Rays

The duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} advances
along rays which change *three* coordinates. In 2D, it doesn't exist,
but if it did, it would advance along a *single* ray[]{.indexref
entry="ray:A directed line segment of unit length that connects adjacent tiles."}.
In 3D, it advances along a *pair* of vertex rays (connects the corners
of adjacent cubes[]{.indexref entry="âvertex"}). A duke linear
move[]{.indexref
entry="linear move:A move along end tiles, blocked by advancement rectangle(s)."}
will thus define a line which changes three coordinates (one more than
the bishop), and a duke quadrant move[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant move:A move into a quadrant, blocking is by an advancement square."}
will define a perimeter but[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} which,
surprisingly, can change one, or two, or three coordinates, depending on
the perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} and the
specific tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
on that perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."}.

For the rook, every pure quadrant[]{.indexref
entry="pure quadrant:Quadrant move which does not include the end tiles."}
tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
on the perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} changed
two coordinates; for the bishop, every pure quadrant[]{.indexref
entry="pure quadrant:Quadrant move which does not include the end tiles."}
tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
on the perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} changed
three coordinates. Moves to end tiles change one less coordinate. The
duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} is stuck,
there are only three coordinates to change (it can't change four), so
the use of two rays 'wraps around', like a modulus function. This is the
first unexpected difference from the previous base pieces; and (teaser)
it has interesting consequences.

### Range[]{.indexref entry="Range:What percentage of the board a piece can eventually reach."} {#range-3}

Because the duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} advances
along rays which change three coordinates, it can reach only a *quarter*
of the tiles on the board (half as many as the bishop), but because it
moves in one dimension less than the board, it can still get to each
tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
it can reach in just *two* moves, just like the other base pieces.

[]{#_Toc210218251 .anchor}Congruent Rule : **The duke**[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} **can reach
only a quarter of the tiles on the board.**

### Six Slant Planes

In 3D, the board is a cube, with faces, edges, and corners. Since the
duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} advances
along corner rays, it moves in []{#slant_plane .anchor}*slant* *planes*.
A slant plane[]{.indexref
entry="slant plane:Plane a duke moves in, separates opposite edges of the board."}
separates opposite *edges* of the board; thus 12 edges in 6 pairs
implies *six* planes. This is the second unexpected difference from the
previous base pieces; six planes instead of three or four. However,
unlike either the rook or the bishop, a straight-line duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} move is in
*three* planes at once, not two. This is the third unexpected difference
from the previous base pieces. At least each slant plane[]{.indexref
entry="slant plane:Plane a duke moves in, separates opposite edges of the board."}
has only two straight lines, so like the rook, each plane has four
quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."},
but like the bishop there are more planes than the previous base
piece[]{.indexref
entry="base piece:A piece which moves along only 1 type of ray; rook, bishop, duke."}.

Like the bishop's *skew* planes, the duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."}'s *slant*
planes come in pairs, called []{#cross_planes .anchor}*cross planes*.
Each pair intersect along an orthogonal line[]{.indexref
entry="orthogonal line:The space a 2D rookâs straight-line moves occur in."}
which connects opposing board faces. The three cross planes[]{.indexref
entry="cross planes:Duke planes come in planes connecting opposing board faces."}
are the []{#vertical_cross_plane .anchor}*vertical cross
planes*[]{.indexref
entry="vertical cross plane:A duke cross plane connecting the top and bottom faces of the board."},
the []{#left_cross_plane .anchor}*left cross planes*[]{.indexref
entry="left cross plane:A duke cross plane connecting the left-hand faces of the board."},
and the []{#right_cross_plane .anchor}*right cross planes*[]{.indexref
entry="right cross plane:A duke cross plane connecting the right-hand faces of the board."}.

It is helpful to see these six planes as a group.

Figure 40 shows the six duke planes inside individual wireframed cubes,
which represent the 3D chess board in symmetric fashion: no level bias.
They naturally arrange themselves in pairs, here grouped vertically.

![[]{#_Ref96350224 .anchor}Figure 40: The Six Duke Slant

The largest major plane holds the starting lineup of the pieces. For
this reason, this one major plane will also be called the *primary
plane*.

Figure 41 shows each pair of duke planes, grouped as cross planes
together in three individual wireframed cubes.

![[]{#_Ref96350234 .anchor}Figure 41: The Three Pairs of Duke Cross

The six slant planes of the duke shown in pairs, the three sets of cross
planes.

The way dukes use slant planes displays a lot of interesting
mathematical properties; if you're a mathematician. For the rest of us,
visualization of the duke move is challenging, and a mathematical
description is of little help. A review of the skew planes of the bishop
move will provide some useful visualization techniques.

Like the orthogonal planes of the rook, and the skew planes of the
bishop, slant planes stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."}; one
can envision 'slipping' sideways from one to the next. This is easy for
the rook, but irrelevant; all the orthogonal planes are the same. For
the bishop, 'sliding' between skew planes *is* relevant; as all the
tiles are white in one, then black in the next, then white, etc. In
other words, there are two colors of skew planes: ones with white tiles
only and ones with black tiles only. Call these *bishop colors*. They
are the same as the board colors. Each player has one bishop which
starts on each color, and we generally refer to them by the color of the
tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
they are on. Both players start with one *white* bishop and one *black*
bishop. Each can reach every tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
in its own colored skew planes[]{.indexref
entry="skew plane:Plane a bishop moves in, separates opposite corners of the board."},
but none of the tiles in the other colored skew planes[]{.indexref
entry="skew plane:Plane a bishop moves in, separates opposite corners of the board."};
"bishops can't change color."

Slant planes are not 'just' more of the same. While they stack, and one
can envision 'slipping' sideways from one to the next, adjacent slant
planes are of different *types*, not of different *colors*. Furthermore,
each type consists of two colors, but each duke can only get to *one* of
them, not both. That is, each duke can only get to *half* of the tiles
in a slant plane, not like the bishop which can get to *all* the tiles
in its skew plane.

To help make this clear, we went to the periodic table for our
nomenclature. Slant planes will have a *metallicity*[]{.indexref
entry="metallicity:Duke tiles come in four âcolorsâ arranged in two metallicities."};
either *metallic*[]{.indexref
entry="metallic:Dukes start on and can only reach metallic âcoloredâ tiles."}
or *gemstone*[]{.indexref
entry="gemstone:Alternating vertical slant planes consisting of gem âcoloredâ tiles."}.
Slipping from one slant plane to another changes the metallicity.
Slipping between the skew planes of the bishop changed *color* (white,
black, white, black etc.), while slipping between the slant planes of
the duke change *metallicity* (metal, gem, metal, gem, etc.).

Within each type of plane, there are two 'colors', *gold* and *silver*
for metallic planes, and *ruby* and *jade* for the gemstone planes. As
elements, gold and silver are metals, as crystals, ruby and jade are
gems. Gold and silver are also colors, and ruby and jade can be
portrayed as colors; a dark red and a dark green shall be used.

Inconveniently, these four 'colors' are equally distributed between the
white and black bishop colors, so to fully 'color' a 3D chess board
takes *eight* colors! A quarter of the white tiles are each of these
four metallicities, as are a quarter of the black tiles. Coloring a 3D
board to show the different types of both skew and slant planes together
requires an 8-color scheme.[^18]

In the *metal planes*, half the tiles are gold, the other half silver;
in the *gem planes*, half the tiles are ruby, the other half jade. The
starting lineup of the pieces is chosen to be a metal plane, so all the
dukes are metal dukes. This means the metal planes are the most
important slant plane[]{.indexref
entry="slant plane:Plane a duke moves in, separates opposite edges of the board."}
metallicity.

Each player gets one *gold*[]{.indexref
entry="gold:1 of 2 duke colored metal tiles, players start with one gold duke."}
duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} and one
*silver*[]{.indexref
entry="silver:1 of 2 duke colored metal tiles, players start with one silver duke."}
duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."}. White's
gold[]{.indexref
entry="gold:1 of 2 duke colored metal tiles, players start with one gold duke."}
duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} is on the
king side, silver[]{.indexref
entry="silver:1 of 2 duke colored metal tiles, players start with one silver duke."}
duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} on the
queen side; just the reverse for Black. Each duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} can only
reach *half* the tiles in the metal planes[]{.indexref
entry="metal plane:Metal planes are vertical slant planes with only gold & silver tiles."},
and *none* of the tiles in the gem planes, but each pair of dukes can
together cover[]{.indexref
entry="cover:Can move to a tile, generic term for attack foe or defend friend."}
all the tiles in the metal planes[]{.indexref
entry="metal plane:Metal planes are vertical slant planes with only gold & silver tiles."}.
Recall that the duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} can only
reach a quarter of the board, so this is how that quarter works out;
half of one metallicity[]{.indexref
entry="metallicity:Duke tiles come in four âcolorsâ arranged in two metallicities."}
(metal), zero of the other metallicity[]{.indexref
entry="metallicity:Duke tiles come in four âcolorsâ arranged in two metallicities."}
(gem). The only major piece that can move in gem planes is the queen,
even pawn promotion occurs only in a metal plane. This is the fourth
unexpected difference from the other base pieces.

It is a bit of a spoiler, but pawns can also capture like a duke, so
when in a gem plane, they, unlike dukes, may also move in such planes
(but only to capture). Pawns will be covered in Chapter 11.

The fact that a duke can actually reach only half the tiles in a
metallic slant plane will not dissuade us from saying that dukes move in
a slant plane, we just chose to mean that they don't move in the full
geometrical slant plane, rather they move in a subset of it, either the
gold subset or the silver subset. In the context of the duke, saying a
piece moves in a slant plane will imply that it moves only in the tiles
of that plane that are the same color as the color of the tile the duke
is currently on.

It is initially a little daunting, but it provides clarity, and no
better jargon has been found.[^19]

The best board encoding uses two techniques. First, gold[]{.indexref
entry="gold:1 of 2 duke colored metal tiles, players start with one gold duke."}
tiles in the primary plane[]{.indexref
entry="primary plane:Largest major plane, contains starting lineup & promotion tiles."},
and only the primary plane[]{.indexref
entry="primary plane:Largest major plane, contains starting lineup & promotion tiles."},
are indicated with a small black dot. They may reside under or over the
tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
decorators on a case-by-case basis; whichever is clearer. The advantages
are that the board is not unduly cluttered (only 32 tiles affected),
duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} accessible
tiles are clear level by level, which tiles are gold[]{.indexref
entry="gold:1 of 2 duke colored metal tiles, players start with one gold duke."}
and which silver[]{.indexref
entry="silver:1 of 2 duke colored metal tiles, players start with one silver duke."}
is trivial to ascertain in the primary plane[]{.indexref
entry="primary plane:Largest major plane, contains starting lineup & promotion tiles."},
and not too hard to abstract in the other planes, and as a bonus,
highlights the starting lineup plane.

The second technique is to treat the board 'squares' as real tiles, thin
three-dimensional objects, with their small edges duke colored, and
their larger flat surfaces bishop colored. This still tends to 'scream'
at the viewer, so most often these colored edges will be masked in
black. However, this allows individual tiles to be 'raised' to reveal
the edge color, which is occasionally useful.

Figure 42 shows both techniques. On every other level only white tiles
are also gold tiles[]{.indexref
entry="gold:1 of 2 duke colored metal tiles, players start with one gold duke."},
while on alternating levels only black tiles are also gold[]{.indexref
entry="gold:1 of 2 duke colored metal tiles, players start with one gold duke."}
tiles. Silver[]{.indexref
entry="silver:1 of 2 duke colored metal tiles, players start with one silver duke."}
tiles are the unmarked tiles diagonally in between gold[]{.indexref
entry="gold:1 of 2 duke colored metal tiles, players start with one gold duke."}
tiles. If the gold[]{.indexref
entry="gold:1 of 2 duke colored metal tiles, players start with one gold duke."}
tiles on one level are white, so are the silver[]{.indexref
entry="silver:1 of 2 duke colored metal tiles, players start with one silver duke."}
tiles. A few metal tiles on the KR level, and a few gem tiles on the QR
& QB level are raised to hint at the patterns. The black masking of the
edges of each level has been removed revealing the metallicity of each
tile on the edge. As you can see, even this little bit of color
dominates the figure.

![[]{#_Ref60863274 .anchor}Figure 42: Duke Colors & Gold Tiles Primary
Slant Plane (32 of the 64 Metal
Tiles)](media/image43.png){alt="A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated with medium confidence"
width="6.5in" height="6.111805555555556in"}

Tiles are color coded with bishop colors on their surfaces and duke
colors on their edges. Dukes start and stay on metal slant planes;
either gold[]{.indexref
entry="gold:1 of 2 duke colored metal tiles, players start with one gold duke."}
or silver[]{.indexref
entry="silver:1 of 2 duke colored metal tiles, players start with one silver duke."}
tiles. They can never reach the gem planes. To help deduce duke colors
without cluttering the board, the gold[]{.indexref
entry="gold:1 of 2 duke colored metal tiles, players start with one gold duke."}
tiles in the primary plane[]{.indexref
entry="primary plane:Largest major plane, contains starting lineup & promotion tiles."}
are marked with black dots. Silver tiles are the unmarked tiles
diagonally in between the gold[]{.indexref
entry="gold:1 of 2 duke colored metal tiles, players start with one gold duke."}
ones. Metal tiles are also black and white tiles but alternate every
other level. Duke colors alternate orthogonally and diagonally. KR1,1 is
a white gold[]{.indexref
entry="gold:1 of 2 duke colored metal tiles, players start with one gold duke."}
tile; ruby[]{.indexref
entry="ruby:One of two duke colored gem tiles, there are no ruby dukes."}
to the right, jade[]{.indexref
entry="jade:One of two duke colored gem tiles, there are no jade dukes."}
to the left.

Once again, software implementations offer a more suitable interface
than static paper.

In 2D, opposing bishops are on *opposite* colors. In 3D, opposing
bishops are on the *same* color; it is *opposing dukes* which are on
*opposite metals*. Remember, the bishop and duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} share some
of the bishop nature because in 2D corner rays change *two* coordinates
and *all* coordinates. The 3D bishop inherits the properties that stem
from changing two coordinates, while the duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} inherits
the properties that stem from changing all the coordinates.

The next three figures show the three pairs of cross planes[]{.indexref
entry="cross planes:Duke planes come in planes connecting opposing board faces."}.
Figure 43 shows the vertical cross planes[]{.indexref
entry="cross planes:Duke planes come in planes connecting opposing board faces."}
([]{#major_plane .anchor}*major plane*[]{.indexref
entry="major plane:Duke vertical cross planes perpendicular to the players."}
& []{#minor_plane .anchor}*minor plane*[]{.indexref
entry="minor plane:Duke vertical cross planes parallel to the players."}),
Figure 44 shows the left cross planes[]{.indexref
entry="cross planes:Duke planes come in planes connecting opposing board faces."}
([]{#upleft_plane .anchor}*upleft plane*[]{.indexref
entry="upleft plane:Duke left cross plane which leans toward opponent."}
& []{#downleft_plane .anchor}*downleft plane*[]{.indexref
entry="downleft plane:Duke left cross plane which leans away from opponent."}),
and Figure 45 shows the right cross planes[]{.indexref
entry="cross planes:Duke planes come in planes connecting opposing board faces."}
([]{#upright_plane .anchor}*upright plane*[]{.indexref
entry="upright plane:Duke right cross plane which leans toward opponent."},
[]{#downright_plane .anchor}*downright plane*[]{.indexref
entry="downright plane:Duke right cross plane which leans away from opponent."}).[]{.indexref
entry="downright plane:Duke right cross plane which leans away from opponent."}
Up and down apply to traversing the plane so as to head toward your
opponent, thus White's up planes are Black's down planes and
vice-a-versa. However, they define the pairs of cross planes the same,
and the major and minor planes as well.

The largest major plane is called the []{#primary_plane .anchor}*primary
plane*[]{.indexref
entry="primary plane:Largest major plane, contains starting lineup & promotion tiles."},
as it holds the starting lineup of the pieces and contains the promotion
tiles for the pawn.

This concludes the introduction of the plane jargon. The names of all
the planes are summarized in the Glossary Tables Appendix. While the
learning curve for any nomenclature can be a bit tedious, the gains are
substantial. Good names facilitate thinking, analysis, memorization, and
communication.

### Four Quadrants

The duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} has one
more surprise; adjacent quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}
are not the same. While a duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} plane has
*four* quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."},
same as the rook, they come in *two flavors*; one advances toward an
edge of the board, []{#edge_quadrant .anchor}*edge
quadrants*[[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}]{.indexref
entry="edge quadrant:A duke quadrant headed towards an edge of the board."},
the other toward a diagonal on a face of the board, []{#face_quadrant
.anchor}*face quadrants*[[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}]{.indexref
entry="face quadrant:A duke quadrant headed towards a face of the board."}.
A quadrant that advances toward a board *edge* is just like the rook and
bishop quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."},
but a quadrant that advances toward a board *face* shares its
apex[]{.indexref
entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."}
tiles with *a quadrant from another plane*, (the other diagonal line
down that face, the cross plane). This is the fifth unexpected
difference from the other base pieces.

Therefore, in contrast to the presentation of the rook and bishop, apex
tiles are introduced in the plane figures instead of waiting for the
quadrant figures. The "dual apex tile" is given its own name,
[]{#duplex_tile .anchor}*duplex tile*. Duplex tiles figure prominently
in both the queen and the stack, so an investment in understanding them
has multiple returns.[]{.indexref
entry="duplex tile:The dual apex tile of duke face quadrants."}

The *vertical cross planes*[]{.indexref

called the *primary* plane[]{.indexref

Duke is on K4,4.

![[]{#_Ref60305676 .anchor}Figure 45: Duke Right Cross Planes (Upright,
Downright)](media/image46.png){alt="Shape Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="6.985416666666667in"}

The right cross planes[]{.indexref
entry="cross planes:Duke planes come in planes connecting opposing board faces."}
intersect in a horizontal line connecting the right faces. The upright
plane[]{.indexref
entry="upright plane:Duke right cross plane which leans toward opponent."}
extends towards the opponent when traversed in the up direction, and in
perfect symmetry, the downright plane[]{.indexref
entry="downright plane:Duke right cross plane which leans away from opponent."}
extends towards the opponent when traversed in the down direction. The
single apex[]{.indexref
entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."}
tiles are all in a left vertical plane[]{.indexref
entry="left plane:Rook plane that is vertical (constant Y-axis)."},
while the duplex tiles align along the right intersection line of the
right cross planes[]{.indexref
entry="cross planes:Duke planes come in planes connecting opposing board faces."}
skipping every other left vertical plane[]{.indexref
entry="left plane:Rook plane that is vertical (constant Y-axis)."}. Duke
is on K4,4.

As one tours the four quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."},
the flavors alternate. It is going to require additional figures to
provide clear visualizations of the duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} move.

Figure 46 shows the tiles a duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} can reach
in a single slant plane[]{.indexref
entry="slant plane:Plane a duke moves in, separates opposite edges of the board."},
the primary plane[]{.indexref
entry="primary plane:Largest major plane, contains starting lineup & promotion tiles."};
recall that it is a metal plane. Since the duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} can only
reach 4 tiles on each level it is easy to confirm that it can reach only
half of them. (32 out of 64). This is a gold duke; the tiles have been
raised to show the gold edges. The two straight lines are shown with
dark rhombus decorators; this clearly shows the four
quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}.
While the shape of a slant plane[]{.indexref
entry="slant plane:Plane a duke moves in, separates opposite edges of the board."}
is rectangular (4x8, 3x8, 2x8, 1x8), the outline of the tiles within it
that a duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} can reach,
follow a zig-zag pattern. The size of the slant plane[]{.indexref
entry="slant plane:Plane a duke moves in, separates opposite edges of the board."}
depends on the location of the duke (like the bishop)[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."}, but the
shape is always rectangular (unlike the 3D bishop). While a slant
plane[]{.indexref
entry="slant plane:Plane a duke moves in, separates opposite edges of the board."}
can connect corners of the board, this is true only for the 4x8 planes.

The two quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}
that advance toward an edge are the left and right quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."},
one advancing toward Black (left) and one advancing toward White
(right). Note the use of the conventional tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
decorator for apex[]{.indexref
entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."}
tiles (open black diamond) in the left and right quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}.
The two quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}
that advance toward the diagonal on a face are the up and down
quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}.
A new tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
decorator is introduced here for duplex tiles as these tiles are also
*reachable in the cross plane*, in this case a minor plane[]{.indexref
entry="minor plane:Duke vertical cross planes parallel to the players."}
(not shown); a *pair* of open black diamonds is used to suggest access
via two planes.

This new decorator was also used in the previous figures, showing the
cross planes[]{.indexref
entry="cross planes:Duke planes come in planes connecting opposing board faces."}.

This is *not* a linear move[]{.indexref
entry="linear move:A move along end tiles, blocked by advancement rectangle(s)."},
these apex[]{.indexref
entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."}
tiles do not align along corner rays, but rather along face rays. This
means that apex[]{.indexref
entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."}
tiles in *face quadrants*[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}
can be attacked in two different planes, each with its own advancement
square[]{.indexref
entry="advancement square:An NxN advancement manifold, must be empty for a legal move."}
(not an advancement rectangle[]{.indexref
entry="advancement rectangle:The advancement manifold for a linear move, both quadrants."},
as would be the case for a linear move[]{.indexref
entry="linear move:A move along end tiles, blocked by advancement rectangle(s)."}).
In contrast, the apex[]{.indexref
entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."}
tiles in *edge quadrants*[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}
are only reachable in one way. The tactical advantages of duplex tiles
should be immediately apparent; such attacks will be harder to
block[]{.indexref
entry="block:Blocks cover, prevents a piece from moving to a desired location."}
requiring either one piece on a previous duplex tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."},
or two separate pieces, each one blocking a different advancement
square[]{.indexref
entry="advancement square:An NxN advancement manifold, must be empty for a legal move."}.[^20]

The openness of the duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."}'s
quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}
introduces a new challenge; it is not enough to sight along a slant
plane[]{.indexref
entry="slant plane:Plane a duke moves in, separates opposite edges of the board."}
to see what pieces a duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} might be
attacking, as only every other tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
is actually under attack. One observation that may help is that on each
level a duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} can only
reach tiles of the *same* bishop color, which *alternates* between
levels.

### Opposing Quadrants

Starting on the following facing pages, the next two figures show
opposing quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}.
Figure 47 shows a pair of normal edge quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}
with two 3x3 advancement squares. Figure 48 shows a pair of the new face
quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."};
with two 3x3 advancement squares. Both cases show how off-board tiles
will be shown. While pieces cannot move off board, being able to
visualize the whole advancement square[]{.indexref
entry="advancement square:An NxN advancement manifold, must be empty for a legal move."}
aids understanding of the move. Ghost dukes show the pure quadrant
moves.

![[]{#_Ref60141554 .anchor}Figure 46: Duke Plane is Cut by Two Lines,
thus Four
Quadrants](media/image47.png){alt="Diagram, shape Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="6.111805555555556in"}

Shown is the *primary major plane*[]{.indexref
entry="major plane:Duke vertical cross planes perpendicular to the players."},
it connects the top and bottom faces of the board and opposing vertical
edges. As the largest major plane[]{.indexref
entry="major plane:Duke vertical cross planes perpendicular to the players."},
it also contains the starting lineup. It's two straight lines are
readily visible and clearly divide the plane, like the rook, into four
quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."},
but unlike rook quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."},
duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."}
quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}
come in two flavors, which alternate around the plane. Those
quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}
advancing toward a board edge (left and right) are regular
quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}.
They use the conventional apex[]{.indexref
entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."}
tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
decorator. Those quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}
advancing toward a diagonal line across a board face (up and down) have
duplex tiles, they are also in the cross plane (minor plane[]{.indexref
entry="minor plane:Duke vertical cross planes parallel to the players."},
not shown). Note that the duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} can only
reach half of the tiles in its plane (32 out of 64). All the tiles in
this plane have been raised so that their edges are visible. Note they
are all gold tiles; the primary plane[]{.indexref
entry="primary plane:Largest major plane, contains starting lineup & promotion tiles."}
is a metallic[]{.indexref
entry="metallic:Dukes start on and can only reach metallic âcoloredâ tiles."}
plane.

If bishop advancement squares appear more like rhombi than squares,
duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} advancement
squares appear more like diamonds, however they still follow the same
perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} growth
rule as the other base pieces (3, 5, 7, 9...). Note that the
duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."}'s
advancement squares extend off the board even more quickly than the
bishop's do, so the use of off-board tiles will be common. Furthermore,
both end and body tiles may leave the board before apex (or duplex)
tiles do, but this is very position dependent. In these examples, the
apex and duplex tiles leave first.

![[]{#_Ref60149573 .anchor}Figure 47: Duke Opposing Edge Quadrants in

Note the one apex decorator off the board. Ghost dukes show the pure
quadrant moves[]{.indexref

(see previous figure). As face quadrants[]{.indexref

they utilize the duplex tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
decorator (pair of open black diamonds). Each sports a 3x3 advancement
square. Note the off board duplex decorator and the ghost
dukes[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant moves:A move into a quadrant, blocking is by an advancement square."}.

### 2D Projection of the 3D Move

Since there is no duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} in 2D
chess, the projection invariant[]{.indexref
entry="invariant:A pattern which remains constant while other things change."}
does not really apply. However, since the 2D bishop changes all the
coordinates in 2D like the duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} does in 3D,
it is worth noting that the duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."}'s linear
move[]{.indexref
entry="linear move:A move along end tiles, blocked by advancement rectangle(s)."}
does reproduce the bishop's 2D move in slant planes. This is more
obvious when the slant plane[]{.indexref
entry="slant plane:Plane a duke moves in, separates opposite edges of the board."}
directly connects opposite board edges as it then has 64 tiles, same as
a 2D board.

Figure 49 shows the duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."}
straight-line moves in the primary major plane[]{.indexref
entry="major plane:Duke vertical cross planes perpendicular to the players."}.
To emphasize this point, the rest of the pieces have been moved from the
tray to their starting lineup positions. The 64 tiles of the primary
plane[]{.indexref
entry="primary plane:Largest major plane, contains starting lineup & promotion tiles."}
can be mapped one-to-one with the 64 squares of the 2D board, one just
has to ignore that the tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
colors don't alternate in both directions.

![[]{#_Ref60307413 .anchor}Figure 49: Duke Pseudo Projection; Linear
Moves in Slant Planes are the 2D Bishop
Move](media/image50.png){alt="Diagram Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="6.111805555555556in"}

The straight-line moves of the duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} in a slant
plane[]{.indexref
entry="slant plane:Plane a duke moves in, separates opposite edges of the board."}
are the 2D bishop's move. This example is in the primary major
plane[]{.indexref
entry="major plane:Duke vertical cross planes perpendicular to the players."},
which contains 64 tiles, 32 of which the duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} can reach.
Other than tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
color, this plane is a one-to-one map with the 2D board, which is why in
this figure most of the pieces have been moved from their tray positions
to their starting lineup position.

### Edge Quadrant Move Snapshots

Recall that the duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} has two
different types of quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."},
edge quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}
and face quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}.
To show snapshots of the duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."}'s growing
advancement square[]{.indexref
entry="advancement square:An NxN advancement manifold, must be empty for a legal move."}
will require two sets of dual figures; the second of each is a
continuation of the first. They are shown on facing pages to facilitate
viewing the growing advancement squares.

Figure 50 shows two snapshots (a) -- (b) of a duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} edge
quadrant move[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant move:A move into a quadrant, blocking is by an advancement square."}

out to perimeters 1 and 2, while Figure 51 continues it (c) with one
more snapshot out to perimeter[]{.indexref

Note, this is a silver duke.

### Face Quadrant Move Snapshots

Figure 52 shows two snapshots (a) -- (b) of a duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} face
quadrant move[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant move:A move into a quadrant, blocking is by an advancement square."}
in the primary plane[]{.indexref
entry="primary plane:Largest major plane, contains starting lineup & promotion tiles."}
out to perimeters 1 and 2, Figure 53 continues it (c) with one more
snapshot out to perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} 3. Note
that the duke is blocked by the pawn from moving to the duplex tiles in
the minor plane. Such tiles are called []{#simplex_tile .anchor}*simplex
tiles*[]{.indexref
entry="simplex tile:A duplex tile blocked in only one of the face quadrants."}.
A new decorator is introduced; one of the diamonds in the duplex
decorator is missing, indicating advancement in only one advancement
square.

![[]{#_Ref60487490 .anchor}Figure 52: Duke Snapshots of Face Quadrant
Simplex Move (Perimeters 1 &
2)](media/image53.png){alt="Diagram Description automatically generated with medium confidence"

Two snapshots of a duke[]{.indexref

quadrant move[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant move:A move into a quadrant, blocking is by an advancement square."}
out to perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} 1 (a)
and perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} 2 (b)
in the major plane[]{.indexref
entry="major plane:Duke vertical cross planes perpendicular to the players."}.
Advance in the minor plane is blocked by the pawn, so the duke can only
advance to the 'apex' tile in this plane. Such tiles are called *simplex
tiles*[]{.indexref
entry="simplex tile:A duplex tile blocked in only one of the face quadrants."},
and simply delete one diamond from the duplex decorator. Primary plane
silver tiles have been raised. Ghost dukes indicate pure quadrant
moves[]{.indexref
entry="major plane:Duke vertical cross planes perpendicular to the players."}.

In the perimeter 3 figure, the silver tiles have not been raised, just
the border of the inner 16 tiles has been shown. Both standards will be
used.

![[]{#_Ref60487531 .anchor}Figure 53: Duke Snapshots of Face Quadrant
Simplex Move (Perimeter
3)](media/image54.png){alt="Diagram Description automatically generated with medium confidence"

(Continues previous figure.) Third snapshot of a duke[]{.indexref

quadrant move[]{.indexref

out to perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} 3 (c)
in the major plane. Advance in the minor plane is blocked by the pawn,
note the simplex tiles[]{.indexref
entry="simplex tile:A duplex tile blocked in only one of the face quadrants."}.
Ghost dukes indicate pure quadrant moves to perimeter 3.

The next two figures show the snapshots for a move to a duplex tile on
perimeter 2: first in the minor plane (a) -- (b) and then in the major
plane (c) -- (d). Such moves occur only in face quadrants. Note that
neither figure places a ghost duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} on any of
the perimeter body tiles. This is because those tiles are reachable in
only one plane. Duplex moves are *not* linear moves, even though they
occur along an orthogonal line, that's a linear move for a rook, not for
a duke. Duplex moves are legal if *either* quadrant is unblocked.

![[]{#_Ref60487819 .anchor}Figure 54: Duke Snapshots of a Duplex Move to
Perimeter 2 First in the Minor
Plane](media/image55.png){alt="A picture containing text Description automatically generated"

and perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} 2 (b)
first in the minor plane only. The silver tiles in this minor plane have
been raised for clarity. Ghost dukes indicate the move. Note the lack of
ghost dukes on the body tiles of perimeter 2.

![[]{#_Ref60487835 .anchor}Figure 55: Duke Snapshots of a Duplex Move to
Perimeter 2 Adding the Major
Plane](media/image56.png){alt="A picture containing shape Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="6.611111111111111in"}

(Continuation of previous figure.) The advancement squares for the major
plane are added in. The single ghost duke on the final duplex tile was
advancing in *both* cross planes[]{.indexref
entry="cross planes:Duke planes come in planes connecting opposing board faces."}.
Note specifically that the ghost duke is[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} *only* on
the duplex tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."},
and there are none on the other tiles on the perimeters as those moves
occur in one plane only. The silver tiles have not been raised, rather
the inner 16 border has been used.

Being cognizant of which flavor of duke quadrant is in play is important
not just for tactics; duplex tiles also play a unique role in those
pieces which are defined in terms of the base pieces.

### Linear Move Snapshots

Like the other base pieces, the duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."}'s linear
move[]{.indexref
entry="linear move:A move along end tiles, blocked by advancement rectangle(s)."}
is composed of two quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."},
however, because the duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} quadrant
comes in two flavors, which alternate around the plane, every linear
move[]{.indexref
entry="linear move:A move along end tiles, blocked by advancement rectangle(s)."}
will have one edge quadrant and one face quadrant. The next few figures
show a potential linear threat on the Black king. Given that the duke
moves in three planes; is the king in check?

![[]{#_Toc210218340 .anchor}Figure 56: Duke Snapshot of Linear Move in
Primary Plane to Perimeter
1.](media/image57.png){alt="A picture containing shape Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="6.195138888888889in"}

The White duke is on a gold tile, as is the Black king. In addition, the
king is in line with the duke, so a linear attack is a possibility; one
must check all three planes. Snapshot of the 2x3 advancement rectangle
at perimeter 1 of the linear threat in the primary plane. Black's pawn
is in a gem plane and thus safe from the duke.

Black's rook is defending his king side pawn at KR4,3) via a left
vertical plane.

![[]{#_Toc210218341 .anchor}Figure 57: Duke Snapshot of Linear Move in
Primary Plane to Perimeter
2.](media/image58.png){alt="Diagram, shape Description automatically generated with medium confidence"
width="6.5in" height="6.195138888888889in"}

(Continuation of previous figure.) Snapshot of the 3x5 advancement
rectangle at perimeter 2 of the linear threat to the king in the primary
plane. The duke has three linear move decorators. At perimeter 1 is the
one with three diamonds, so at this point, the move is in all three duke
planes. At perimeter 2, however, one of the diamonds is hollowed, so one
of the other planes is blocked; the duke is polarized in two planes.
Notice that one end tile also sports a change in their decorator at
perimeter 2 (KR5,5), for the same reason. The inner black diamond is
smaller, indicating that a linear move in this direction would be
blocked in one plane as well.

![[]{#_Toc210218342 .anchor}Figure 58: Duke Snapshot of Linear Move in

(Continuation of previous figure.) Snapshot of the 4x7 advancement
rectangle at perimeter 3 of the linear threat to the king in the primary
plane. The third duke linear move decorator has only one diamond of
three that is solid, indicating a linear move polarized in one plane
only, so the king is not in check in either of the other two duke
planes. Advance to perimeter 4 is blocked by the rook in a face quadrant
so the king is not in check in the primary plane either. Note that the
king is not threatening the rook, for it is covered by the duke. Both
are on raised tiles to indicate the duke threat. Note the four
decorators off the board to make the advancement rectangle a little
clearer.

While White can capture Black's rook with her bishop (green 4x4
advancement square in the upward plane), there is a more interesting
gambit[]{.indexref
entry="gambit:Standard sequence of moves with a well establish purpose or outcome."}.
If RxP (right vertical plane) this discovers the duke check (primary
plane), so Black's defense of the pawn via his rook becomes useless, for
it cannot immediately capture the White rook, but which is now
threatening it. After the king moves out of check, RxR (right vertical
plane), and the game is hopeless; Black resigns.

If Black blocks the discovered check with his rook at perimeter 4
(QB1,1), RxP, which pins the rook against the king *and* pins the king
against the rook; the rook cannot move, it puts the king in check, but
these are the only pieces Black has left, so the king *must* move. When
it does, DxR, and again the game is hopeless; Black resigns.

If Black blocks the discovered check with his rook to an earlier
perimeter, DxR, and the duke still protects the rook, so the king cannot
take it. The pawn is vulnerable and easily picked off by White. If black
sacrificed his rook so as to block[]{.indexref
entry="block:Blocks cover, prevents a piece from moving to a desired location."}
White's rook's advance to the KR level, then RxR instead of DxR. In
either case, R--KR6,6, pawn advances on the KR level, RxP. Again, Black
resigns.[^21]

Note that three new decorators have been added to the icon repertoire;
they each sport *three* small diamonds[]{.indexref
entry="linear move:A move along end tiles, blocked by advancement rectangle(s)."},
representing that along linear moves, the duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} is
advancing in *three* planes. For unpolarized moves, all three diamonds
are black. For a move partially polarized in two planes, two diamonds
are black, the other one is hollow. For a move fully polarized in just
one plane, only one diamond is black, the other two are hollow. To help
see this progression the usual use of a ghost piece has been abandoned.

The so-called advancement rectangle[]{.indexref
entry="advancement rectangle:The advancement manifold for a linear move, both quadrants."}
of a base piece[]{.indexref
entry="base piece:A piece which moves along only 1 type of ray; rook, bishop, duke."}'s
linear move[]{.indexref
entry="linear move:A move along end tiles, blocked by advancement rectangle(s)."}
is less distorted for the duke than for the bishop. However, the same
perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} growth
rule as for the other base pieces applies (5, 9, 13...). Note the four
tiles off the board which are included solely to better highlight the
4x7 advancement rectangle[]{.indexref
entry="advancement rectangle:The advancement manifold for a linear move, both quadrants."}.

The duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."}'s linear
move[]{.indexref
entry="linear move:A move along end tiles, blocked by advancement rectangle(s)."}
requires six quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}
in 3 planes that from the neutral perspective are not cleanly separated.
It is a little clearer on a real physical three-dimensional board;
players tend to walk around the board, their heads bobbing like
ducklings, but seeing each plane clearly pretty much requires three
perspectives. A good presentation in a software implementation can do
even better. That is why each of the three planes have been presented
separately rather than altogether as is more feasible with the rook and
the bishop.

### Linear Move in Three Planes

Now to confirm that the king is not in check in either of the other two
duke planes.

Figure 59 shows that the duke's linear move is blocked in the downright
plane by the knight at perimeter 2.

![[]{#_Ref66114725 .anchor}Figure 59: Duke Linear Move Blocked by Knight
in Downright Plane at Perimeter
2.](media/image60.png){alt="A picture containing background pattern Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="6.111805555555556in"}

White's knight (KB7,3) blocks her duke's (KB3,3) potential linear attack
on Black's king (KN2,2) in the downright plane at perimeter 2 in a face
quadrant. Knight and underlying tile are raised to emphasize this. The
knight is on a duplex tile of a face quadrant. The advancement rectangle
is 2x3. At perimeter 1 (K4,4) the duke's move is not yet polarized. Note
the decorator has *three* solid diamonds indicating linear motion in
*three* planes.

Figure 60 shows that the duke's linear move is blocked in the downleft
plane by the bishop at perimeter 3.

![[]{#_Ref66114745 .anchor}Figure 60: Duke Linear Move Blocked by Bishop
in Downleft Plane at Perimeter
3.](media/image61.png){alt="A picture containing diagram Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="6.111805555555556in"}

White's bishop (QR8,2) blocks her duke's (KB3,3) potential linear attack
on Black's king (KN2,2) in the downleft plane at perimeter 3 in an edge
quadrant. Bishop and underlying tile are raised to emphasize this. The
advancement rectangle is 3x5. At perimeter 2 (Q5,5) the duke's move is
now polarized into just two planes. Note the decorator has *two* solid
diamonds and one hollowed, indicating linear motion in *two* planes.

Note the sequence of regular apex[]{.indexref
entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."}
tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
decorators for the growing advancement square[]{.indexref
entry="advancement square:An NxN advancement manifold, must be empty for a legal move."}
in the edge quadrant, as well as the sequence of duplex tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
decorators for the growing advancement square[]{.indexref
entry="advancement square:An NxN advancement manifold, must be empty for a legal move."}
in the face quadrant.

### Shape

Unlike the rook and bishop, placing the duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} in the
corner of the board and marking all the tiles it can get to in a single
move reveals no discernable shape. Therefore, since the duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} moves along
rays connecting the corners of adjacent cubes, the shape chosen for the
duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} is a
*pivoted* *cube*, with one corner cut off to provide a stable base. This
makes the base three sided, and by hollowing out the interior of the
cube, the duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} can sit
nicely on top of the bishop, so a new shape is not required for the
stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."};
indeed, the stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."}
actually looks more like a conventional bishop than the tetrahedral
shape does.

Figure 61 shows all the tiles a duke can cover from a corner of the
board. Note the triple linear moves down the super diagonal, the apex
tiles down the plane diagonals, and the duplex tiles down the
orthogonals. Interestingly, there are 10 covered tiles in every
orthogonal plane.

### Power Projection

From the corner of the board, the duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} covers 72
tiles via quadrant move (of which 18 are apex[]{.indexref
entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."}
tiles; 9 edge quadrant tiles, 9 face quadrant tiles), and 7 tiles via
linear move[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."}, for a
total of 79 tiles. Power projection[]{.indexref
entry="Power projection:The percentage of tiles a piece can reach in one move."}
is 79/511 = 15.5% compared to the bishop in 2D would have been no better
than 7/63 = 11.1% in 2D. Power projection[]{.indexref
entry="Power projection:The percentage of tiles a piece can reach in one move."}
for the duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} is position
dependent. The debunked straight-line move[]{.indexref
entry="straight-line move:A move in a straight line which cuts a 2D board."}
would have been 7/511 = 1.37% -- *feels like chess*[]{.indexref
entry="feels like chess:Play in 3D must feel like chess, a one pawn advantage wins."}*.*

From the center of the board, 3D straight-line moves would have been
1\*7 + 3\*6 = 25 out of 511 = 4.89%, but the planar move[]{.indexref
entry="planar move:A move without a trajectory in a plane which cuts a 3D board."}
is better. Cross planes have 32 & 28 tiles, minus the 4 tiles of the
intersection line and source, each cross-plane pair thus has 56 tiles.
The 25 straight-line tiles got counted thrice so subtract 50 and
subtract another 3 since the source tile was counted once for each pair
of cross planes[]{.indexref
entry="cross planes:Duke planes come in planes connecting opposing board faces."}.
Thus, 56\*3 -- 50 -- 3 = 115, and 115/511 = 22.5%.

As in 2D, power projection for the base pieces decreases from the rook
on.

Marking all the tiles a duke[]{.indexref

unlike for the rook and bishop. Since the duke[]{.indexref

quadrants).

### Review

The duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} is to the
bishop much like the bishop is to the rook. Its move is governed by rays
which change *three* coordinates; thus, it moves in a different type of
plane, a *slant* plane, and can reach only *a quarter* of the tiles on
the board. As the bishop stays on whatever *color* it starts on, the
duke stays on whatever *metallicity* it started on. For the
duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} that is one
of the two *metal* tiles; either *gold*[]{.indexref
entry="gold:1 of 2 duke colored metal tiles, players start with one gold duke."}
or *silver*[]{.indexref
entry="silver:1 of 2 duke colored metal tiles, players start with one silver duke."}.
Only the queen can make duke like moves in the *gem planes*. Like the
other base pieces, it can get to any tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
it can reach in just two moves.

Some jargon to recall; corner (vertex) rays, slant planes, cross plane
pairs[]{.indexref
entry="cross planes:Duke planes come in planes connecting opposing board faces."},
vertical cross planes[]{.indexref
entry="cross planes:Duke planes come in planes connecting opposing board faces."},
(major and minor), left cross planes[]{.indexref
entry="cross planes:Duke planes come in planes connecting opposing board faces."}
(upleft and downleft), right cross planes[]{.indexref
entry="cross planes:Duke planes come in planes connecting opposing board faces."}
(upright and downright), 6 planes each with 4 quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."};
all new. The largest major plane[]{.indexref
entry="major plane:Duke vertical cross planes perpendicular to the players."}
contains the starting lineup of the pieces and is called the primary
plane[]{.indexref
entry="primary plane:Largest major plane, contains starting lineup & promotion tiles."}.
Duke quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}
come in two flavors, edge quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}
and face quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."},
and linear moves occur in three planes, one quadrant of the advancement
rectangle[]{.indexref
entry="advancement rectangle:The advancement manifold for a linear move, both quadrants."}
is an edge quadrant, the other is a face quadrant. The duplex tiles of
face quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}
are in two different planes, cross planes[]{.indexref
entry="cross planes:Duke planes come in planes connecting opposing board faces."},
which can be attacked in both, but it is not a linear move[]{.indexref
entry="linear move:A move along end tiles, blocked by advancement rectangle(s)."},
there is no advancement rectangle[]{.indexref
entry="advancement rectangle:The advancement manifold for a linear move, both quadrants."},
just two independent advancement squares[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}.

Then as for the rook and bishop; quadrant moves[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant moves:A move into a quadrant, blocking is by an advancement square."}
versus linear moves, advancement squares (rhombus shaped) and
advancement rectangles (double rhombus), perimeters, apex[]{.indexref
entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."}
tiles, linear tiles and end tiles, multiple new diamond tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
decorators (open, closed, double, offset, triples, etc.), and of course
more congruent rules[]{.indexref
entry="congruent rules:Rules for chess which are dimension agnostic."}.

In addition, the duplex tile for face quadrants came in a simplex form
for when one of the two advancements squares is blocked.

Finally, new polarization states for linear moves; not polarized
(advancing in all three planes), partial polarization (advancing in just
two planes) and full polarization (advancing in only one plane).

## Queen

The queen is just the sum of the base pieces.[^22] In 2D, she can move
like either the rook or the bishop. In 3D, she can move like either the
rook, bishop, or duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."}.

[]{#_Toc210218252 .anchor}Congruent Rule : **The queen is the sum of the
base pieces.**

The queen is generally considered to be slightly more powerful than the
sum of the base pieces, since in addition to their raw power, she also
has the flexibility of choosing what piece to move like. Since there are
three base pieces in 3D chess, she is relatively more powerful in 3D
than in 2D.

### Queen on Her Own Color

In 2D, this was a consequence of the way the board is tiled (black and
white squares), and the way the pieces line up to start the game.
However, in 3D, both queens start on white tiles.

Given the insistence that 3D chess should *feel like chess*[]{.indexref
entry="feel like chess:Play in 3D must feel like chess, a one pawn advantage wins."},
this may seem like a place where it doesn't, where the
discovery[]{.indexref
entry="discovery:Rules to 3D chess must be discovered, not invented."}
objective fails. However, now that the duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} has been
covered, and we've learned that the duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."}, by virtue
of it only being able to reach a quarter of the tiles on the board,
requires *four* colors, we can appreciate the subtle point that the
queens do in fact start on opposite colors; opposite *duke*[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} colors, not
opposite *bishop* colors. It may help to review Figure 42.

The White queen starts on a gold[]{.indexref
entry="gold:1 of 2 duke colored metal tiles, players start with one gold duke."}
tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."},
the Black queen on a silver[]{.indexref
entry="silver:1 of 2 duke colored metal tiles, players start with one silver duke."}
one. Like all the pieces, they start life in a metallic[]{.indexref
entry="metallic:Dukes start on and can only reach metallic âcoloredâ tiles."}
slant plane[]{.indexref
entry="slant plane:Plane a duke moves in, separates opposite edges of the board."},
the primary plane[]{.indexref
entry="primary plane:Largest major plane, contains starting lineup & promotion tiles."},
the largest major plane[]{.indexref
entry="major plane:Duke vertical cross planes perpendicular to the players."}.
Here is another degeneracy in 2D chess; the board is tiled black and
white, and the pieces are black and white, but it is a coincidence. Many
rollup boards have green and white tiles, some even brown and white
tiles; but we humans are so good at patterns that even on these boards,
the adage "queen on her own color," is easily accommodated. We mentally
map green or brown to black without even noticing the translation.

With malice aforethought, the figures for projecting the 3D rook and
bishop moves onto 2D surfaces used 2D comparison boards without black
tiles. The rook 2D board used green instead of black, while the bishop
2D board used brown instead of black.

[]{#_Toc210218253 .anchor}Congruent Rule : **Queens start on opposite
colors of the highest base piece**[]{.indexref
entry="base piece:A piece which moves along only 1 type of ray; rook, bishop, duke."}**.**

### Overlap Tiles

This is not the only surprise from the queen, however. In 2D, she can
attack a tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
as *either* a rook, *or* as a bishop, but *not both*. In 3D, there are
[]{#overlap_tile .anchor}*overlap* tiles[]{.indexref
entry="overlap tile:Tiles attackable as more than one base piece."}, a
few tiles which she can attack as more than one base piece[]{.indexref
entry="base piece:A piece which moves along only 1 type of ray; rook, bishop, duke."}.
There are four kinds of overlap tiles[]{.indexref
entry="overlap tile:Tiles attackable as more than one base piece."};
tiles she can attack as both rook and bishop, as both rook and
duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."}, as both
bishop and duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."}, and as
both rook, bishop, and duke.

Being able to attack as more than one type of piece means that an
opponent will have to block[]{.indexref
entry="block:Blocks cover, prevents a piece from moving to a desired location."}
more than one attack. When one move results in more than one piece being
attacked (simple fork[]{.indexref
entry="fork:Simultaneously attacking two or more pieces with one move."}),
it is not possible to block[]{.indexref
entry="block:Blocks cover, prevents a piece from moving to a desired location."}
both attacks with a single move. When one move results in a single piece
being attacked in two different ways (discovered fork[]{.indexref
entry="fork:Simultaneously attacking two or more pieces with one move."}),
it is also not possible to block[]{.indexref
entry="block:Blocks cover, prevents a piece from moving to a desired location."}
both attacks with a single move. Both of these situations can occur in
2D chess, and in 3D chess as well.

What is new is that a single piece, without using a discovered
fork[]{.indexref
entry="fork:Simultaneously attacking two or more pieces with one move."},
can nonetheless attack another such that it may not be possible to
block[]{.indexref
entry="block:Blocks cover, prevents a piece from moving to a desired location."}
the attack with a single move. Such an attack will be called a []{#quark
.anchor}*quark*[]{.indexref
entry="quark:Refers to an attack that generally requires more than one piece to block."};
it rhymes with 'fork[]{.indexref
entry="fork:Simultaneously attacking two or more pieces with one move."}'
and since it begins with a 'q', it alludes to the queen as well.
Sometimes a quark[]{.indexref
entry="quark:Refers to an attack that generally requires more than one piece to block."}
can be blocked with a single piece, but only by placing the blocking
piece on an 'earlier' overlap tile of the same type. The rest of the
time, blocking requires multiple pieces. This has significant tactical
implications since with shrewd moves, a player can short-circuit the
general 'attack-block[]{.indexref
entry="block:Blocks cover, prevents a piece from moving to a desired location."},
attack-block[]{.indexref
entry="block:Blocks cover, prevents a piece from moving to a desired location."}'
cycle.

A summary of the four overlap tiles[]{.indexref
entry="overlap tile:Tiles attackable as more than one base piece."} is
presented in the [Table of Overlap Tiles]{.underline} in the Glossary
Table Appendix III.

To show queen moves, a new set of decorators is introduced. Except for
the overlap tiles, they are just variations on what has already been
introduced, but with the addition of a purple border (royal color)
around them. To avoid being too cluttered, they emphasize what kind of
base piece[]{.indexref
entry="base piece:A piece which moves along only 1 type of ray; rook, bishop, duke."}
can reach a tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
rather than the type of tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}.

Figure 62 shows them all for a queen at the center of the chess board.
Each overlap tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
is discussed below along with additional figures.

### Brook Tiles

A []{#brook_tile .anchor}*brook* *tile*[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
is an overlap tile which the queen may attack as either a rook or a
bishop. The name is a mangled 'bishop-rook'. A brook tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
is always an apex[]{.indexref
entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."}
tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
in a rook quadrant, and an end tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
in a bishop linear move[]{.indexref
entry="linear move:A move along end tiles, blocked by advancement rectangle(s)."}.
There are thus *three* advancement manifolds which must be blocked; one
advancement square[]{.indexref
entry="advancement square:An NxN advancement manifold, must be empty for a legal move."}
(rook) and two advancement rectangles (bishop).

The decorator consists of two nested diamonds: a red inner one for the
rook, and a green outer one for the bishop. From the center of the
board, the queen covers 24 brook tiles: 4 on the KN and K levels, 8 on
the Q level, and 4 on the QB and QR levels. This is every other level.
More generally, every other orthogonal plane, whether it be a left
vertical plane, a right vertical plane, or a horizontal plane (level).

![[]{#_Ref66197680 .anchor}Figure 62: Queen Quark Attacks from Board
Center to 60 Overlap
Tiles](media/image63.png){alt="Shape, background pattern Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="7.858333333333333in"}

All the queen *quark* moves from the center of the board; 24 *brook*
tiles, 15 *q-tiles*, 9 *hotspots*, 12 *Feynman* tiles, for a total of 60
*overlap* tiles. Note the new decorators with nested diamonds; colors
indicate the base piece that cover such tiles. 12 rook and 25 duke
linear tiles are also shown.

### Q-tiles

A []{#q_tile .anchor}*q-tile*[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
is an overlap tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
which the queen may attack as either rook, bishop, or duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."}. A
q-tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
is always an apex[]{.indexref
entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."}
tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
in a rook quadrant, an end tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
in a bishop linear move[]{.indexref
entry="linear move:A move along end tiles, blocked by advancement rectangle(s)."},
*and* an apex[]{.indexref
entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."}
tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
in a duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} edge
quadrant; a four-way attack, i.e., *four* advancement manifolds that
must be blocked; one advancement square[]{.indexref
entry="advancement square:An NxN advancement manifold, must be empty for a legal move."}
(rook), two advancement rectangles (bishop), and another advancement
square[]{.indexref
entry="advancement square:An NxN advancement manifold, must be empty for a legal move."}
(duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} edge
quadrant). That's a lot, so the name for this overlap tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
was chosen because it rhymes with 'futile' and since it starts with 'q',
it also alludes to the queen. Q-tiles occur every duke apex tile, but
only every other brook tile, even perimeters only for rook and bishop.

The decorator consists of three nested diamonds: from inner to outer,
blue, green, and red, for duke, bishop, and rook respectively. From the
center of the board the queen covers 15 q-tiles.

Brook and q-tiles alternate down *diagonal* lines in orthogonal planes.
The rook and bishop can get to every diagonal tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."},
but the duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} can only
get to every other one. Another way to think of a q-tile is as a duke
apex and a brook tile. If only the duke attack is blocked, then all the
rest of the q-tiles down that diagonal revert to brook tiles.

Figure 63 shows a combined example of the queen advancing down a
diagonal in the horizontal plane. The first ghost queen is on Q4,4, a
*brook* tile. It is a silver tile, but the queen started on a gold tile,
so no duke move goes there. It is a perimeter 3 apex rook move and a
perimeter 3 linear bishop move. The rook and bishop advancement
manifolds are shown in red and green respectively. Instead of the usual
base piece decorators, the overlap decorators are used wherever they
apply.

The second ghost queen is on Q5,5, a *q-tile*. It is a gold tile and on
perimeter 2 of a duke edge quadrant. The 3x3 advancement square for the
duke is shown (blue). The advancement manifolds for the rook and bishop
would be just one perimeter larger than what is shown on the board.
Note, that the bishop advancement rectangles would start to leave the
board for the q-tile attack.

If the queen was advancing only to Q3,3, that would be
perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} *two*
for the rook and bishop, but perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} *one*
for the duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."}. In that
case, just mentally strip off the latest perimeter for all the
advancement manifolds shown in the figure.

Combined diagram showing a queen advancing to alternating brook and
q-tiles. The rook and bishop advancement manifolds are shown for an
advance to the brook tile at Q4,4, and the duke advancement square is
shown for an advance to the q-tile at Q5,5. Brook tiles alternate with
the q-tiles down diagonal lines. Both are on the apex[]{.indexref
entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."} of a
rook quadrant move[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant move:A move into a quadrant, blocking is by an advancement square."},
and on the end tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
of a bishop linear move[]{.indexref
entry="linear move:A move along end tiles, blocked by advancement rectangle(s)."}
in two planes. The q-tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
is also on the apex[]{.indexref
entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."} of a

color). To reduce clutter, queen decorators emphasize what *kind* of
base piece[]{.indexref

over what *type* of tile, or number of manifolds for pure base piece
attacks[]{.indexref

decorators have two nested diamonds, green and red, and the
q-tile[]{.indexref

decorators have three nested diamonds (red, green, blue). The next
subsections introduce hotspot and Feynman tiles, which are included in
this figure to highlight the relationships between all the overlap
tiles.

### Hotspot Tiles

The third overlap tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
for the queen is the []{#hotspot_tile .anchor}*hotspot*[]{.indexref
entry="hotspot:Tile attackable as both rook (linear) & duke (duplex)."},
tiles she can reach as either a rook or a duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."}. A
hotspot[]{.indexref
entry="hotspot:Tile attackable as both rook (linear) & duke (duplex)."}
tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
is an end tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
in a rook linear move[]{.indexref
entry="linear move:A move along end tiles, blocked by advancement rectangle(s)."}
(two advancement rectangles), and a duke duplex[]{.indexref
entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."} move
in a face quadrant (two advancement squares). Thus, in general, it takes
four pieces to block[]{.indexref
entry="block:Blocks cover, prevents a piece from moving to a desired location."}
an attack on a hotspot[]{.indexref
entry="hotspot:Tile attackable as both rook (linear) & duke (duplex)."}
tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."},
i.e., *four* advancement manifolds -- hot spot indeed.

Figure 64 shows the White queen advancing to a hotspot[]{.indexref
entry="hotspot:Tile attackable as both rook (linear) & duke (duplex)."}.
Like the q-tiles, hotspot[]{.indexref
entry="hotspot:Tile attackable as both rook (linear) & duke (duplex)."}
tiles alternate, in this case with rook end tiles down *orthogonal*
lines. A hotspot[]{.indexref
entry="hotspot:Tile attackable as both rook (linear) & duke (duplex)."}
tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
is on the duplex[]{.indexref

tiles of the duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} face
quadrant move[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant move:A move into a quadrant, blocking is by an advancement square."}
at perimeter[]{.indexref

diagonal sequence, the duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} can only
get to every other tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
down the hotspot[]{.indexref
entry="hotspot:Tile attackable as both rook (linear) & duke (duplex)."}/linear-rook
orthogonal sequence, but in this case, it is a dual attack (a pair of
advancement squares) rather than a single attack (a single advancement
square[]{.indexref
entry="advancement square:An NxN advancement manifold, must be empty for a legal move."}).

![[]{#_Ref60931245 .anchor}Figure 64: Queen Quark (Alternating Hotspot &
Rook Linear
Tiles)](media/image65.png){alt="Diagram Description automatically generated with medium confidence"
width="6.5in" height="6.430555555555555in"}

Hotspot tiles[]{.indexref
entry="overlap tile:Tiles attackable as more than one base piece."} are
the duplex tiles of duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} face
quadrants at perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} N and
the linear tiles[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
of rook linear moves[]{.indexref

at 2N. They are thus in *four* advancement manifolds. Hotspot tiles
alternate with rook linear tiles down orthogonal lines. Shown are the
rook advancement rectangle[]{.indexref
entry="advancement rectangle:The advancement manifold for a linear move, both quadrants."}s
out to perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} 4 and
the pair of duke advancement squares in the upright and downright slant
planes out to perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} 2. The
hotspot[]{.indexref
entry="hotspot:Tile attackable as both rook (linear) & duke (duplex)."}
decorator consists of two nested diamonds, blue surrounded by red. For
the queen, both rook and duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} end
tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
decorators are replaced with the linear tile idiom, two inline diamonds
for the rook, and three inline diamonds for the duke. Rook

entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."}
tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
decorators are replaced with brook decorators. This substitution helps
clarify the relationships between the overlap tiles.

### Feynman Tiles

The fourth and last overlap tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
is called a []{#Feynman_tile .anchor}*Feynman* *tile*[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}.[^23]
The reason for this name won't become apparent until the discussion of
the stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."}. The
queen (and the stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."}) may
attack a Feynman tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
as either a bishop or a duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."}. A Feynman
tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
is on every other bishop apex[]{.indexref
entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."} tile
and on every third duke edge quadrant perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} on a
tile 1/3 of the way from each end tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
to the apex[]{.indexref
entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."}
tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}.
From the perspective of the duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} planes,
Feynman tiles come in pairs, but occur four orthogonal planes away, so
the second pair is always off the board. There is therefore a maximum of
12 on the board at any time. The members of each pair, while in the same
duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} plane, are
in different bishop planes.[^24]

Figure 65 shows one pair of Feynman tiles[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
for a White queen on her KR4,4 tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}.
That places her on a silver[]{.indexref
entry="silver:1 of 2 duke colored metal tiles, players start with one silver duke."}
tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}.
The two Feynman tiles are on the perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} 3 of
the downward facing duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} face
quadrant (4x4 advancement square[]{.indexref
entry="advancement square:An NxN advancement manifold, must be empty for a legal move."})
in the primary plane[]{.indexref
entry="primary plane:Largest major plane, contains starting lineup & promotion tiles."};
both are on the queen level and both sport ghost queens for emphasis.
Each Feynman tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
is on the apex[]{.indexref
entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."} of a
3x3 bishop advancement square[]{.indexref
entry="advancement square:An NxN advancement manifold, must be empty for a legal move."}
(perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} 2); one
in each forward plane[]{.indexref
entry="forward plane:The two bishop planes that lean toward the opponent."}.

That is not the only beauty of this figure; all four of the queen's
overlap tiles[]{.indexref
entry="overlap tile:Tiles attackable as more than one base piece."} are
evident. There are *four brook* tiles on the KN level, they are the
initial linear moves of the two bishop quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}.
Next level down are the *four q-tiles*, the perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} 2
linear bishop moves. Down the vertical orthogonal line[]{.indexref
entry="orthogonal line:The space a 2D rookâs straight-line moves occur in."}
are *three hotspots*, attackable via linear rook and duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} duplex
attacks in the face quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}
of the major and minor (not shown) planes. Finally, there are *two
Feynman* tiles on the queen level; they are at the apex[]{.indexref
entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."}
positions of bishop 3x3 advancement squares.

This is a figure worth studying, as it shows the relationships between
the overlap tiles[]{.indexref
entry="overlap tile:Tiles attackable as more than one base piece."}. For
instance, every other hotspot[]{.indexref
entry="hotspot:Tile attackable as both rook (linear) & duke (duplex)."}
tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
lies between a pair of Feynman tiles.

30 tiles have decorators in this figure, the queen is on one of them. Of
the remaining 29, there are ten tiles the queen can attack through only
1 advancement manifold[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."}. The four
brook tiles can be attacked in 3 advancement manifolds, the four q-tiles
can be attacked in 4, and the four hotspots can be attacked in 4. The
six linear duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} moves can
be attacked in 3 advancement rectangles, and the two Feynman tiles can
be attacked in 2 advancement quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}.
To block[]{.indexref
entry="block:Blocks cover, prevents a piece from moving to a desired location."}
attacks on all of these 29 tiles could require up to 10\*1 + 4\*3 +
4\*4 + 4\*4 + 6\*3 + 2\*2 = 76 pieces; more than start the game.

The 3D queen is a fearsome piece.

![[]{#_Ref61041775 .anchor}Figure 65: Queen Quark (Feynman
Tiles)](media/image66.png){alt="Diagram Description automatically generated with medium confidence"
width="6.5in" height="6.111805555555556in"}

Feynman tiles can be attacked as either a bishop or a duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."}, both
quadrant moves[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant moves:A move into a quadrant, blocking is by an advancement square."}.
Feynman tiles come in pairs; on the 3N perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} of a
duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} face
quadrant move[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant move:A move into a quadrant, blocking is by an advancement square."}
1/3 of the way from end tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
to dual apex[]{.indexref
entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."}
tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
and simultaneously on the bishop apex[]{.indexref
entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."}
tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
of 2N perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."}. Note
also the existence of the other three overlap tiles[]{.indexref
entry="overlap tile:Tiles attackable as more than one base piece."};
four brook tiles, four q-tiles, and three hotspot[]{.indexref
entry="hotspot:Tile attackable as both rook (linear) & duke (duplex)."}
tiles.

### Overlap Shells

To block[]{.indexref
entry="block:Blocks cover, prevents a piece from moving to a desired location."}
an attack on an overlap tile with just one piece requires placing the
blocking piece on an earlier overlap tile of the same family. A blocking
piece on a q-tile will not only block[]{.indexref
entry="block:Blocks cover, prevents a piece from moving to a desired location."}
all farther attacks on q-tiles but also on brook tiles. A blocking piece
on a brook tile will block[]{.indexref
entry="block:Blocks cover, prevents a piece from moving to a desired location."}
all farther attacks on brook tiles, but not on q-tiles; however, it will
reduce the number of pieces required to completely block[]{.indexref
entry="block:Blocks cover, prevents a piece from moving to a desired location."}
attacks to later q-tiles to just one (duke-apex) instead of the usual
four. Brook and q-tiles are in the same family.

Similar arguments apply to hotspots and rook linear tiles. While rook
linear tiles are not formally overlap tiles, they do imply multiple
advancement manifolds. Thus, a blocking piece on a hotspot tile will
block[]{.indexref
entry="block:Blocks cover, prevents a piece from moving to a desired location."}
attack on all successive hotspot tiles and all successive linear rook
tiles. The reverse is not true, but a blocking piece on a linear rook
tile will reduce by two (duke-duplex) the number of pieces required to
block[]{.indexref
entry="block:Blocks cover, prevents a piece from moving to a desired location."}
later hotspots. Hotspots and linear rook tiles are in the same family.

Linear duke moves are a family unto themselves.

These multiple attack tiles can be envisioned as arranged in
[]{#overlap_shells .anchor}*overlap* *shells*[]{.indexref
entry="overlap shell:Refers to the radial ordering of the sets of overlap tiles."}
centered on the queen. Effective blocking occurs by placing a piece on
an earlier shell. However, Feynman tiles, being every other bishop apex
tile, quickly leave the board, indeed they leave so quickly that from
the center of the board not all the shell one Feynman tiles are even on
the board. Even from the corner, the closet shell two Feynman tiles out
are just off the board. To see any of them requires a 9x9x9 board, which
from a queen in the center would also sport all the shell one Feynman
tiles.

This makes Feynman tiles a little harder to understand, but also gives
them a powerful tactical edge; there are no earlier shell tiles
available for single piece blocking.

### Shape

Figure 66 shows all the tiles the queen can attack from a corner of the
board. They suggest a slender, twisty shape, that gets lighter as one
goes up, but nothing unique.

Potential shapes for the queen might be any elegant shape shorter and
slenderer than the king that suggest she can move like the other base
pieces, so a twisted torso makes a good queen. In this work, a six-sided
star cross section was chosen.

- The rook can simultaneously cover[]{.indexref
  entry="cover:Can move to a tile, generic term for attack foe or defend friend."}
  12 tiles; 3 orthogonal planes times 4 quadrants[]{.indexref
  entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}.

- The bishop can simultaneously cover[]{.indexref
  entry="cover:Can move to a tile, generic term for attack foe or defend friend."}
  24 tiles; 4 skew planes times 6 quadrants[]{.indexref
  entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}.

- The duke[]{.indexref
  entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} can
  simultaneously cover[]{.indexref
  entry="cover:Can move to a tile, generic term for attack foe or defend friend."}
  24 tiles; 6 slant planes times 4 quadrants[]{.indexref
  entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}.

Therefore, the queen can cover[]{.indexref
entry="cover:Can move to a tile, generic term for attack foe or defend friend."}
60 pieces, more than start the game. The six-point star of the queen
design used here alludes to the 60 advancement squares she has access
to. A 13-point cross section (one point for each plane) would also work.
Her shape is the least fixed by the invariant[]{.indexref
entry="invariant:A pattern which remains constant while other things change."}
that a piece should allude to how it moves; lots of possible
interpretations.

### Power Projection

Figure 67 shows all the tiles the queen can attack from the center of
the board. Unlike Figure 66, she is on a gem tile (ruby). While there is
beautiful symmetry here, there is also a sublime complexity. Before
extending our growing Power Projection Table, we'll need to generate an
analysis on all the tiles the queen can cover. This is complicated by
the overlap tiles. The pair of facing figures on the next two pages
provide raw material to collect some stats on how the queen and her
component base pieces project their power.

Two tables will be used, one for the queen in the corner of the board,
the other from the center. Hotspots alternate with but are also rook
linear tiles. Brook and q-tiles alternate but both are bishop linear
tiles. Feynman tiles alternate with but are also bishop apex tiles.
(This analysis was done by hand.[^25])

The totals in color are all that the straight-line rules would yield. As
for 2D chess, the queen and bishop lose power when they approach the
limits of the board as does the duke. Only rook-like moves are not
reduced by being closer to the boundary of the board.

The queen covers 289 tiles[]{.indexref

from a corner of the board. It's impressive, but chaotic. Pretty much
any design shorter and shapelier than the king which alludes to her
being able to move like any of the base pieces should do.

  : []{#_Toc210218554 .anchor}Table 6: **Power Projection Ratios
  (PPR**[]{.indexref
  entry="PPR:Power projection ratio, portion of the board reachable in 1 move."}**)
  -- Rook thru Queen**

What is immediately apparent is how low the PPR[]{.indexref
entry="PPR:Power projection ratio, portion of the board reachable in 1 move."}
is for straight-line moves; roughly 300% to 400% lower. In contrast, the
PPRs for planar moves are much closer to the 2D values, around 40-50%
higher. In addition, the rook continues to dominate the PPR[]{.indexref
entry="PPR:Power projection ratio, portion of the board reachable in 1 move."}
for base pieces, whereas for the straight-line rules the bishop
dominated, inverting the 2D case. Each new base piece is less powerful
than the previous one.

The queen's jump in PPR[]{.indexref
entry="PPR:Power projection ratio, portion of the board reachable in 1 move."}
is substantial; she gains the option of moving as a third piece (the
duke). Queen sacrifices are going to be even more dramatic.

### Review

The simple congruent rule that the queen is the sum of the base pieces
hides the full richness of the queen. Not only can she move like any of
the base pieces, she can cover[]{.indexref
entry="cover:Can move to a tile, generic term for attack foe or defend friend."}
many tiles as more than one piece; these are called *overlap*
tiles[]{.indexref
entry="overlap tile:Tiles attackable as more than one base piece."} and
come in four types. *Brook* tiles are covered as both rook and bishop,
*q-tiles* are covered as all three base pieces, *hotspots* are covered
as both rook and duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."}, and
*Feynman* tiles are covered as both bishop and duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."}.

Brook and q-tiles *alternate diagonally*, hotspot[]{.indexref
entry="hotspot:Tile attackable as both rook (linear) & duke (duplex)."}
tiles and rook linear moves *alternate orthogonally.* All the overlap
tiles[]{.indexref
entry="overlap tile:Tiles attackable as more than one base piece."} are
on somebody's apex[]{.indexref
entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."}
tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."},
with q-tiles being on both rook apex[]{.indexref
entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."}
tiles and duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} edge
quadrant apex[]{.indexref
entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."}
tiles. Feynman and bishop apex tiles also alternate.

New decorators were introduced to deal with the overlap
tiles[]{.indexref
entry="overlap tile:Tiles attackable as more than one base piece."}, and
all are bordered in purple. Unlike the dukes, she can move in the gem
slant planes. The initially jarring fact that both queens start on white
tiles was resolved by noting that the congruent rule is that queens
start on *opposite colors of the highest base piece*[]{.indexref
entry="base piece:A piece which moves along only 1 type of ray; rook, bishop, duke."}*,*
in this case the duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."}. The White
queen starts on a gold[]{.indexref
entry="gold:1 of 2 duke colored metal tiles, players start with one gold duke."}
tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."},
the Black queen on a silver[]{.indexref
entry="silver:1 of 2 duke colored metal tiles, players start with one silver duke."}
tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}.

Additional new jargon included *quark* and *overlap shells*.

The queen's power projection is formidable, about 60% larger than in 2D.

## Knight

Discovery of the planar move[]{.indexref
entry="planar move:A move without a trajectory in a plane which cuts a 3D board."}
was achieved by recognizing that the concept of base pieces would allow
how the pieces move to be *coupled*[]{.indexref
entry="couple:Knight couples to the board as the anti-queen, anti to all base pieces."}
to the board. When the board changed, so then would the moves. It is
not, however, obvious how the 2D knight move is coupled[]{.indexref
entry="couple:Knight couples to the board as the anti-queen, anti to all base pieces."}
to the board. The place to start is to determine the correct invariants,
the ones that yield play that *feels like chess*.

### Invariants

The 2D knight move always changes *color*, but in 3D there are two
choices for colors: *bishop* color and *duke*[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} color. The
2D knight changes *both* coordinates and does so *unequally*. The 2D
knight can (eventually) reach *every* tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
on the board. These are important invariants.

The guiding constant throughout the descriptions of how base pieces move
was that pieces advance according to their type; along *single* rays in
2D, but along a *pair* of rays in 3D. Since the knight jumps rather than
advances, that guide no longer applies, and the concept of an
advancement manifold[]{.indexref
entry="advancement manifold:Regular region of tiles which must be empty to permit move."}
is invalid.

There are many ways to describe the 2D knight's move. While degenerate
in 2D, each way yields a different 3D knight move. Once again, the
challenge of a conceptual degeneracy[]{.indexref
entry="conceptual degeneracy:Two descriptions only equivalent at a lower level of abstraction."}
arises. Which rule is best, which one scales, which one is dimension
agnostic[]{.indexref
entry="dimension agnostic:Rules of chess which scale to higher dimensions as invariants."}?
Adherence to the discovery[]{.indexref
entry="discovery:Rules to 3D chess must be discovered, not invented."}
principle implies that the one to pick is the one that preserves
'chessness.' Are there any that do?

Below is a brief critique of the more obvious options.

**Fixed rook move, one tile by two:** in any orthogonal plane the knight
makes two rook-like moves, either two tiles by one, or one tile by two.
This violates the 2D invariant that rooks and knights can't
simultaneously attack each other, it reduces the knight's reach, so the
knight loses all the knight endgame races.

**Knight makes N linear rook moves:** N, then N-1 at right angles, then
N-2 at right angles to both, etc. This violates the 2D invariant that a
knight changes color when it moves. It also extends the knight's reach,
allowing the knight to win endgame races it loses in 2D.

**Knight makes two advances, one as rook, one as a bishop:** Like the
previous rule, this violates the 2D invariant that a knight changes
color when it moves and it extends the knight's reach, allowing the
knight to win endgame races it loses in 2D.

**Knight makes a straight-line move like each base piece:** Order of the
moves and the definition of 'right-angle' are both ambiguous. Violates
color change, extends the knight reach, perturbing all the knight
endgames.

**Knight makes a 1 perimeter advance like each base piece:** Again,
violates the 2D invariant that a knight changes color when it moves, but
this rule grossly extends the knight's range distorting both midgame and
openings in addition to the endgames.

Five obvious choices, all bad. All correctly describe the knight move in
2D, they are degenerate descriptions of its move; all equivalent in 2D,
but all different in 3D. Is it possible none scale to higher dimensions?
Have we finally found the reason chess in three dimensions is
impossible, that chess is fundamentally and irredeemably a
two-dimensional game? Or is it just that our list is incomplete; that
there is some *sixth* way of describing the knight move?[^26]

### 5x5x5 Queen

Figure 68 shows the tiles the queen can cover[]{.indexref
entry="cover:Can move to a tile, generic term for attack foe or defend friend."}
in one move that are within a 5x5 square (25 tiles) centered on the
queen in 2D (a), and those she can cover[]{.indexref
entry="cover:Can move to a tile, generic term for attack foe or defend friend."}
within a 5x5x5 cube (125 tiles) centered on the queen in 3D (b). In 2D
she can cover[]{.indexref
entry="cover:Can move to a tile, generic term for attack foe or defend friend."}
16 tiles, 8 she cannot, while in 3D she can cover[]{.indexref
entry="cover:Can move to a tile, generic term for attack foe or defend friend."}
100 tiles, 24 she cannot. Note that in both versions, the color of the
tiles the queen cannot reach are opposite of the color she is on.

![[]{#_Ref61260577 .anchor}Figure 68: Knight as the Anti-Queen (Queen
Covered Tiles Within a 5^N^
Manifold)](media/image69.png){alt="A picture containing shape Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="5.336111111111111in"}

Shown are all the tiles a 2D queen can cover[]{.indexref
entry="cover:Can move to a tile, generic term for attack foe or defend friend."}
in a 5x5 square (a), and all the tiles a 3D queen can cover[]{.indexref
entry="cover:Can move to a tile, generic term for attack foe or defend friend."}
in a 5x5x5 cube (b). The tiles she can't cover[]{.indexref
entry="cover:Can move to a tile, generic term for attack foe or defend friend."}
(8 and 24) are precisely the tiles the knight can cover[]{.indexref
entry="cover:Can move to a tile, generic term for attack foe or defend friend."}.

### 5x5x5 Knight

Figure 69 shows the tiles the knight can cover[]{.indexref
entry="cover:Can move to a tile, generic term for attack foe or defend friend."}
in one move that are within a 5x5 square (25 tiles) centered on the
knight in 2D (a), and those he can cover[]{.indexref
entry="cover:Can move to a tile, generic term for attack foe or defend friend."}
within a 5x5x5 cube (125 tiles) centered on the knight in 3D (b). In 2D
he can cover[]{.indexref
entry="cover:Can move to a tile, generic term for attack foe or defend friend."}
8 tiles, 16 he cannot, while in 3D he can cover[]{.indexref
entry="cover:Can move to a tile, generic term for attack foe or defend friend."}
24 tiles, 100 he cannot. Not only does this move for the 3D knight
change *bishop* colors, but it also changes *duke* colors.

![[]{#_Ref61259783 .anchor}Figure 69: Knight Covers those Tiles the
Queen Cannot in a 5^N^
Array](media/image70.png){alt="A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated with low confidence"
width="6.5in" height="5.336111111111111in"}

The knight is the anti-queen. In 2D, he covers the 8 tiles in a 5x5
square the queen does not (a) and in 3D he covers the 24 tiles within a
5x5x5 cube which she does not (b). The knight changes *both* bishop and
duke colors and it projects the 2D move onto each face of the 5x5x5
cube. Its move within a slant plane is its 2D move. The duke-colored
board has been used and destination tiles raised; the knight changes to
the other color in its current metallicity on adjacent levels, but
changes to the other metallicity two levels away. Knight on a jade tile,
changes to a ruby tile one level away, but to gold or silver tiles two
levels away, 8 of each of the other colors.

Knight moves will be indicated with yellow decorators; a large black
diamond insert for the source tile, and nested yellow diamonds for the
destination tiles[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}.

### 2D Projection of the 3D Move

Consider the tiles the knight can cover[]{.indexref
entry="cover:Can move to a tile, generic term for attack foe or defend friend."}
on each of the six faces of the 5x5x5 cube. (Refer to Figure 69). They
are just the 8 tiles the 2D knight could cover[]{.indexref
entry="cover:Can move to a tile, generic term for attack foe or defend friend."}
if placed in the center of each face. The projection of the 3D knight
move onto a 2D surface is the 2D move. Also note that within a slant
plane[]{.indexref
entry="slant plane:Plane a duke moves in, separates opposite edges of the board."}
the 3D move is the 2D move.

### Congruent Rules

The knight is the only piece that does not advance, it jumps. It cannot
be blocked.

[]{#_Toc210218254 .anchor}Congruent Rule : **The knight does not
advance, it jumps; thus, it cannot be blocked.**

The important invariant[]{.indexref
entry="invariant:A pattern which remains constant while other things change."}
to preserve is that asymmetrical nature of the queen and knight.

[]{#_Toc210218255 .anchor}Congruent Rule : **The knight is the only
piece which can attack the queen without a counterattack.**

Therefore, consider the knight to be an anti-queen; the queen advances,
the knight jumps; the queen has unlimited range[]{.indexref
entry="range:What percentage of the board a piece can eventually reach."},
the knight a limited range[]{.indexref
entry="range:What percentage of the board a piece can eventually reach."};
the queen can be blocked, the knight cannot.

[]{#_Toc210218256 .anchor}Congruent Rule : **The knight is the
anti-queen, range**[]{.indexref
entry="range:What percentage of the board a piece can eventually reach."}
**limited to a 5^N^ boundary, cannot be blocked.**

[]{#_Toc210218257 .anchor}Congruent Rule : **Projection of the 3D knight
move onto a 2D surface is the 2D knight move.**

### Knight Move Changes Colors (Both Bishop and Duke)

Figure 69 shows that the knight changes both bishop and duke colors.
Discovery does not happen all at once. Sometimes discovery[]{.indexref
entry="discovery:Rules to 3D chess must be discovered, not invented."}
takes a little time. By defining the knight as the anti-queen, a
tactical asymmetry was preserved, and the knight changed board colors
with every move. Pretty good confirmation that the right rule for the
knight move in 3D had been discovered. But since there is no
duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} in 2D,
initially, the existence of duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} colors was
not even expected. Now we know they are important. What a pleasant
surprise (and confirmation) that the knight also changes
duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} colors as
well as bishop (board) colors.

[]{#_Toc210218258 .anchor}Congruent Rule : **The knight changes all
higher order base piece**[]{.indexref
entry="base piece:A piece which moves along only 1 type of ray; rook, bishop, duke."}
**colors.**

### Coverage

In chess, the knight can eventually reach every tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
on the board. A simple and far from optimal way of demonstrating this is
shown in Figure 70. In 2D, it takes a sequence of 3 moves to return to
an orthogonal adjacent tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."},
while in 3D it takes a sequence of 5 moves. Thus, a knight can run the
board and return in 2D in no more than 3\*64 = 192 moves, while the
knight can run the board and return in 3D in no more than 5\*512 = 2,560
moves. In both cases, its path includes tiles with each of the post rook
base piece colors.

![[]{#_Ref66376046 .anchor}Figure 70: Knight Coverage
Proof](media/image71.png){alt="Background pattern Description automatically generated with low confidence"
width="6.5in" height="5.336111111111111in"}

The knight can (eventually) reach every tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
on the board. In both boards, the duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} starts on
the king rook initial tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}.
In 2D, a simple three move sequence brings the knight to an adjacent
side square (a), in 3D, a simple five move sequence brings the knight to
an adjacent face cube (b). While not optimal, they prove the knight can
reach every tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
on the board in no more than 192 moves in 2D and 2560 moves in 3D. For
the 3D case, tiles have been raised to reveal the duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} colors to
reveal the sequence (G: S, G, R, G, J). In 3D, interestingly, the even
moves []{#lite .anchor}*lite*[]{.indexref
entry="lite:The knight does not advance (it canât be blocked), it lites upon a tile."}
upon the same color as the knight started on, with each of the other
colors visited exactly once.

### Shape

The shape chosen for the knight is just the adjacent face cubes that
yield its move; its shape is quite exactly its move; two out, two up,
one over. The 'one over' provides the traditional turn of the horse's
head. Tile color[]{.indexref
entry="cover:Can move to a tile, generic term for attack foe or defend friend."}
will be yellow.

![[]{#_Toc62302724 .anchor}Figure 71: Knight
Shape](media/image72.png){alt="Shape Description automatically generated"
width="2.236111111111111in" height="2.0in"}

The knight's shape is quite literally its move; two out, two up, one
over; just permute the directions. The knight traverses five cubes.
Knight decorators are yellow.

### Power Projection

From the corner of the board, the 2D knight can cover[]{.indexref
entry="cover:Can move to a tile, generic term for attack foe or defend friend."}
only 2 tiles, but from the center he can cover[]{.indexref
entry="cover:Can move to a tile, generic term for attack foe or defend friend."}
8 tiles; 2/63 = 3.17% and 8/63 = 12.7%. From the corner of the board,
the 3D knight can cover only 3 tiles, but from the center he can cover
24 tiles: 3/511 = 0.59% and 24/511 = 4.70%.

The knight loses a lot of power on the 3D board, which makes its status
as the anti-queen even more relevant.

### Review

There were a lot of possible ways to define the 2D knight move. The one
that scaled well, the one that was dimension agnostic[]{.indexref
entry="dimension agnostic:Rules of chess which scale to higher dimensions as invariants."},
was to define the knight as the anti-queen. This keeps the all-important
asymmetry where queen and knight cannot counterattack each other, thus
helping to ensure that gambits *feel like chess*[]{.indexref
entry="feel like chess:Play in 3D must feel like chess, a one pawn advantage wins."}.

The projection of the 3D knight move yields the 2D move on both
orthogonal and slant planes. It also changes color with each move; both
the bishop colors and the duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} colors as
well, the latter being an unexpected confirmation that the anti-queen is
the right rule for the knight. It also changes all coordinates and does
so unequally, and it can eventually reach all the tiles on the board,
with at least one algorithm that is dimension agnostic[]{.indexref
entry="dimension agnostic:Rules of chess which scale to higher dimensions as invariants."}.

For the math inclined, the Euclidean distance of the knight move is

> $\sqrt{(2^{2} + 1^{2})}\ $Â =Â $\sqrt{5}$Â =Â 2.24 (1)

for 2D, and

> $\sqrt{(2^{2} + 2^{2} + 1^{2})}$Â =Â $\sqrt{9}$Â =Â 3.00 (2)

for 3D.

It would be interesting to see if the meta-formula implied by the
sequence of equations (1) and (2) is valid for 4D chess.

> $\sqrt{(2^{2} + 2^{2} + 2^{2} + 1^{2})}$Â =Â $\sqrt{13}$Â =Â 3.61 (3)

In any case, this seems like a reasonable value. We appear to have
chosen the correct invariant to honor.

## Stack {#stack-1}

Probably the easiest place to critique this variation on the rules of
three-dimensional chess is to point out the apparent incompatibility
between the stated goal, 'feels like chess[]{.indexref
entry="feels like chess:Play in 3D must feel like chess, a one pawn advantage wins."},'
and the stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."}; the
composite piece of bishop and duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."}, "Ain't no
stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."} in
2D chess."

### Justification

The justification for the stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."}
comes down to the problem of board size and shape. Placing the dukes on
either side of the royal pieces, followed by bishop, knight and rook
respectively is a reasonable starting lineup on either a 10x10x10[^27]
or an 8x8x10 board. The former leads to a major piece war followed by a
pawn war. While addressable by allowing the pawn a triple advance, they
then outstrip their knight protections, and the en passant[]{.indexref
entry="en passant:Balance rule allowing PxP to a tile where it would have been."}
permutations double. While an asymmetrical board introduces only a
handful of problems for endgames, mostly pawn races between kings and
knights, its lack of board symmetry scales badly with larger dimensions.

There is, therefore, a case to be made for the stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."}, but
it is a distributed case; the current development, even by the end of
this chapter, may strike some as still short of satisfactory. However,
as the presentation of the game proceeds, additional justification for
the stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."} will
appear, rather unexpectedly. Indeed, even the final chapter will provide
additional rationale for the appropriateness of the stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."}.[^28]

### Overlap Tiles

It should be clear from the queen that the stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."} is
going to have a few tiles where it may move as both a bishop and a
duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} (to two of
the queen's four overlap tiles[]{.indexref
entry="overlap tile:Tiles attackable as more than one base piece."}, in
fact). Unlike the queen however, which can move like *either* a bishop
or a duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."}, the
stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."} must
be able to move to such tiles as *both* a bishop and a duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."}. If either
sub piece is blocked, the stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."} is
blocked. That means two advancement manifolds will have to be open for
the stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."} to
move as a stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."}.

If the stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."} were
allowed to move as either a bishop or a duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."}, the bishop
move could be used to change the duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} color, and
the duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} move could
be used to change the bishop color, which would allow the
stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."} to
reach every tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
on the board. It would be less of a departure from *feels like
chess*[]{.indexref
entry="feels like chess:Play in 3D must feel like chess, a one pawn advantage wins."},
to simply drop the duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} altogether.

Figure 72 shows the tiles the stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."}
covers as a stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."};
it's pretty sparse. Stack decorators have an orange border like queen
decorators have a purple border. One of the overlap tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
decorators is for q-tiles (without the red decorator to indicate a rook
move), the other is for Feynman tiles.

From the starting position, there are 9 q-tiles and 5 Feynman tiles.
Like the queen, q-tiles lie on a perimeter N apex[]{.indexref
entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."} of a
duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} edge
quadrant move[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant move:A move into a quadrant, blocking is by an advancement square."},
but on a perimeter 2N end tile of a bishop linear move[[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}]{.indexref
entry="linear move:A move along end tiles, blocked by advancement rectangle(s)."};
thus, one advancement square[]{.indexref
entry="advancement square:An NxN advancement manifold, must be empty for a legal move."}
(duke[]{.indexref

of two advancement rectangles (bishop) must be empty for the
stack[]{.indexref

a duke[]{.indexref

quadrant move[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant move:A move into a quadrant, blocking is by an advancement square."}
to perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} 3N, and
lies on the tile[]{.indexref

to apex[]{.indexref
entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."}
tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."};
thus, one advancement square[]{.indexref
entry="advancement square:An NxN advancement manifold, must be empty for a legal move."}
(duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."}) and one
advancement square[]{.indexref
entry="advancement square:An NxN advancement manifold, must be empty for a legal move."}
(bishop) must be empty for the stack[]{.indexref

Tiles](media/image73.png){alt="Shape, background pattern Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="6.985416666666667in"}

Stack decorators are bordered in orange like queen decorators are
bordered in purple. From the home location, each stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."} can
cover[]{.indexref
entry="cover:Can move to a tile, generic term for attack foe or defend friend."}
9 q-tiles and 5 Feynman tiles. White king side stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."}
shown.

### Coverage

To achieve reasonable coverage, but more critically to allow independent
bishops and dukes on the board, we are going to have to allow the stack
to decompose.

Figure 73 shows the tiles the sub pieces can reach, part bishop, part
duke.

![[]{#_Ref67406518 .anchor}Figure 73: Stack Coverage via Sub
Pieces](media/image74.png){alt="Shape, arrow Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="6.985416666666667in"}

The tiles a stack covers as either a bishop or a duke. New decorators
are introduced, but they follow previous idioms. Note the linear moves,
bishop alternation patterns, and duke duplex tiles.

From the home location, the White kingside stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."} can
decay[]{.indexref
entry="decay:Just the bishop, or just the duke sub piece, separates from the stack."}
to 79 gold[]{.indexref
entry="gold:1 of 2 duke colored metal tiles, players start with one gold duke."}
duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} tiles, 94
white bishop tiles. They share 14 overlap tiles[]{.indexref
entry="overlap tile:Tiles attackable as more than one base piece."}; 9
q-tiles and 5 Feynman tiles, thus cover 159 tiles.

Figure 74 shows the advancement manifolds for a stack moving to a
q-tile.

![[]{#_Ref67410062 .anchor}Figure 74: Stack Advancement Manifolds for a
Move to a
Q-Tile](media/image75.png){alt="Shape, arrow Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="6.985416666666667in"}

This is a linear move for the bishop sub-piece (outward planes) and an
apex move for the duke sub-piece (primary plane). Note the linear move
decorator. Ghost stack shows the destination.

As a pair, a rook and a stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."},
have a similar power projection with respect to the queen in 3D, as a
rook and a bishop have to the queen in 2D, for obvious reasons; their
sum is the queen.

Figure 75 shows the advancement manifolds for a stack moving to a
Feynman tile.

![[]{#_Ref67410076 .anchor}Figure 75: Stack Advancement Manifolds for a
Move to a Feynman
Tile](media/image76.png){alt="Shape Description automatically generated with medium confidence"
width="6.5in" height="6.985416666666667in"}

This is an apex move for the bishop sub-piece (leftward plane) and face
quadrant move for the duke sup-piece (downleft plane). Note the
alternation patterns. Ghost stack shows the destination.

Trick question for the advanced; how do you get Black's
white-silver[]{.indexref entry="white-silver:Blackâs king side stack."}
stack in Figure 75 to his Q3,3 tile? It is composed of a white bishop
and a silver duke.

### Decay

To have bishops and dukes as independent pieces on the board, there must
be one or more mechanisms by which the stack may separate into its two
component sub pieces. The first mechanism is called []{#_decay
.anchor}*decay*[]{.indexref
entry="decay:Just the bishop, or just the duke sub piece, separates from the stack."};
the stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."} may
[]{#emit .anchor}*emit*[]{.indexref
entry="emit:Stack decays by emitting either the bishop or the duke sub piece."}
either a bishop or a duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."}. The
emitted sub piece may make either a quadrant move[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant move:A move into a quadrant, blocking is by an advancement square."}
or a linear move[]{.indexref
entry="linear move:A move along end tiles, blocked by advancement rectangle(s)."}
without regard to the left behind sub piece.

Figure 76 shows a stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."}
decay[]{.indexref
entry="decay:Just the bishop, or just the duke sub piece, separates from the stack."}
emitting a duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."}.

![[]{#_Ref61425747 .anchor}Figure 76: Stack Decay - White Emits
Duke](media/image77.png){alt="A screenshot of a video game Description automatically generated with low confidence"

White's queen side stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."}
(black bishop, silver[]{.indexref
entry="silver:1 of 2 duke colored metal tiles, players start with one silver duke."}
duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."}) decays
emitting a duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} to KN5,1.
Move is in an edge quadrant in the upleft plane[]{.indexref
entry="upleft plane:Duke left cross plane which leans toward opponent."}
to the apex[]{.indexref
entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."}
tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
of a 3x3 advancement square[]{.indexref
entry="advancement square:An NxN advancement manifold, must be empty for a legal move."},
which is the first q-tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
in this direction. This means both the duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} and the
bishop cover[]{.indexref
entry="cover:Can move to a tile, generic term for attack foe or defend friend."}
each other. Note that the duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} is fading
out of the stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."}
(QB1,1) leaving only the bishop.

In general, the emitted sub piece will defend the stationary sub piece,
but unless it moves to an overlap tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."},
the reverse is not true.

While it is not unreasonable to restrict decay[]{.indexref
entry="decay:Just the bishop, or just the duke sub piece, separates from the stack."}
to the first move, the side-effect of this to prohibit moves as a
stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."}.
This does tie more closely with the size/shape justification for the
stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."}, but
it denies the richness of 3D chess. It also delays major piece
development by one move, which has an impact[]{.indexref
entry="impact:Measures of a pieceâs ability to affect the game; range, PPR, & stab."}
on openings.

Note that if the bishop and duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} are still
stacked when captured, both sub pieces are removed from the board. Once
they have separated, it's each man for himself.

Figure 77 shows a stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."}
decay[]{.indexref
entry="decay:Just the bishop, or just the duke sub piece, separates from the stack."}
emitting a bishop.

Black's queen side stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."}
(black bishop, gold[]{.indexref
entry="gold:1 of 2 duke colored metal tiles, players start with one gold duke."}
duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."}) decays
emitting a bishop to KN4,8, (same tile as the duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} from the
previous figure). Move is in the forward up quadrant of the rightward
plane[]{.indexref
entry="rightward plane:Bishop plane that in the up direction leans outward to the right."}
(Black's perspective) to a tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
on the perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} of a
5x5 advancement square[]{.indexref
entry="advancement square:An NxN advancement manifold, must be empty for a legal move."}.
This is not an overlap tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."},
so while the bishop is covering the duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."}, the
duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} is not
covering the bishop. Note that the bishop is fading out of the
stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."}
(QB1,1) leaving a hanging duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} (which will
drop to the tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}).

### Recombination

The moves of base pieces in chess are []{#time_symmetric .anchor}*time
symmetric*[]{.indexref
entry="time symmetric:The fundamental moves of chess are time symmetric (base pieces)."};
the set of tiles a rook, bishop or duke can get to on the *next* move is
precisely the set of tiles it had to come from on the *previous* move.
The time inversion of decay is []{#recombination-1
.anchor}*recombination*[]{.indexref
entry="recombination:A bishop or duke reconstituting a stack by moving onto the other."}.

Figure 78 shows each player recombining their remaining stacks.

![[]{#_Ref61437610 .anchor}Figure 78: Stack
Recombination](media/image79.png){alt="Background pattern Description automatically generated with medium confidence"
width="6.5in" height="5.7444444444444445in"}

Two examples of *recombination*[]{.indexref
entry="recombination:A bishop or duke reconstituting a stack by moving onto the other."}
are shown. White's gold[]{.indexref
entry="gold:1 of 2 duke colored metal tiles, players start with one gold duke."}
duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} recombines
with its white bishop on KB1,1 via a duplex move[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant move:A move into a quadrant, blocking is by an advancement square."}
with two independent 3x3 advancement squares in the up
quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}
of the major and minor planes (half the tiles are off the board, shown).
Black's white bishop recombines with its silver[]{.indexref
entry="silver:1 of 2 duke colored metal tiles, players start with one silver duke."}
duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} on Q1,3 via
a 4x4 advancement square[]{.indexref
entry="advancement square:An NxN advancement manifold, must be empty for a legal move."}
in the down forward quadrant of the leftward plane[]{.indexref
entry="leftward plane:Bishop plane that in the up direction leans outward to the left."}.
Destination tiles have ghosted duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} and bishop
respectively. Neither sub piece must be on an overlap tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}.

For both players, it is their respective white bishop stacks which are
reconstituted.

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| By the way, the bishop in each stack[]{.indexref                                         |
| entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."} is attacking the     |
| other stack[]{.indexref                                                                  |
| entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."}. If it is White's    |
| move, she has an opportunity to gain a stack[]{.indexref                                 |
| entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."} advantage. Black     |
| does not have this option since White's king can capture the bishop if it takes the      |
| stack[]{.indexref entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."}.   |
| It is not known if a bishop and duke[]{.indexref                                         |
| entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} can force a mate against a  |
| lone king, so even if it is White's move, it looks like this game will end in a          |
| stalemate.                                                                               |

| It is worth noting that the White king, even though it is on a straight line             |

+==========================================================================================+

### Cross Combination

Both players start with two stacks, but they are not of the same type.
White starts with a *gold* duke stacked on top of a *white* bishop on
her king side, and a *silver* duke stacked on top of a *black* bishop on
her queen side. Black starts with a *silver* duke stacked on top of a
*white* bishop on his king side, and a *gold* duke stacked on top of a
*black* bishop on his queen side, the reverse pairing.

Since together the two players cover[]{.indexref
entry="cover:Can move to a tile, generic term for attack foe or defend friend."}
all the permutations, if recombination[]{.indexref
entry="recombination:A bishop or duke reconstituting a stack by moving onto the other."}
is allowed, it seems reasonable to allow []{#cross_combination
.anchor}*cross combinations* as well.

After separating both stacks, White should be free to move her white
bishop onto the silver[]{.indexref
entry="silver:1 of 2 duke colored metal tiles, players start with one silver duke."}
duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} or
vice-a-versa, or of course recombine her black bishop with her
gold[]{.indexref
entry="gold:1 of 2 duke colored metal tiles, players start with one gold duke."}
duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."}. Similar
for Black, white bishop with gold[]{.indexref
entry="gold:1 of 2 duke colored metal tiles, players start with one gold duke."}
duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} or black
bishop with silver[]{.indexref
entry="silver:1 of 2 duke colored metal tiles, players start with one silver duke."}
duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."}.

The description of what *kind* of stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."} is
going to get wordy, mentioning both bishop and duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} when that
is implied, and allowing cross combinations is going to increase the
confusion. Therefore, the following naming convention is proposed;
[]{#bishop_duke_order .anchor}*bishop-duke order*[]{.indexref
entry="bishop-duke order:Naming convention for starting stacks."} for
the starting stacks, and []{#duke_bishop_order .anchor}*duke-bishop
order*[]{.indexref
entry="duke-bishop order:Naming convention for cross-combined stacks."}
for any subsequent cross combined stacks (hyphens, not a slash).

White starts with a []{#white_gold .anchor}*white-gold*[]{.indexref
entry="white-gold:Whiteâs king side stack."} stack (king side) and
[]{#black_silver .anchor}*black-silver*[]{.indexref
entry="black-silver:Whiteâs queen side stack."} stack (queen side),
while Black starts with a []{#white_silver
.anchor}*white-silver*[]{.indexref
entry="white-silver:Blackâs king side stack."} stack (king side) and a
[]{#black_gold .anchor}*black-gold*[]{.indexref
entry="black-gold:Blackâs queen side stack."} stack (queen side).

White's cross combination[]{.indexref
entry="cross combination:Stack composed of a king side bishop and queen side duke (or reverse)."}
stacks are []{#gold_black .anchor}*gold-black*[]{.indexref
entry="gold-black:A White cross-combined stack, gold duke, black bishop."}
and []{#silver_white .anchor}*silver-white*[]{.indexref
entry="silver-white:A White cross-combined stack, silver duke, white bishop."},
while Black's cross combination[]{.indexref
entry="cross combination:Stack composed of a king side bishop and queen side duke (or reverse)."}
stacks are []{#gold_white .anchor}*gold-white*[]{.indexref
entry="gold-white:A Black cross-combined stack, gold duke, white bishop."}
and []{#silver_black .anchor}*silver-black*[]{.indexref
entry="silver-black:A Black cross-combined stack, silver duke, black bishop."}.
King side and queen side are ambiguous for cross combined stacks as each
sub piece is from a different side. []{#gem_based_stack .anchor}*Gem
based stacks* (ruby, jade) are not disallowed, there is just no way for
them to show up given the initial conditions. However,
devious[]{.indexref
entry="devious:Gambits which leverage broken 2D invariants."} chess
puzzle creators might very well sneak such stacks into their
puzzles.[^29]

Figure 79 shows White with a cross-combined stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."},
gold[]{.indexref
entry="gold:1 of 2 duke colored metal tiles, players start with one gold duke."}-black,
on K2,2,

Note that recombination[]{.indexref
entry="recombination:A bishop or duke reconstituting a stack by moving onto the other."}
is a []{#strict_move .anchor}*strict* *move*[]{.indexref
entry="strict move:One that cannot capture, pawn advance, stack combine, teleportation."},
it cannot achieve capture.

![[]{#_Ref61440234 .anchor}Figure 79: Stack Cross
Combination](media/image80.png){alt="A picture containing text Description automatically generated"
width="6.458333333333333in" height="3.2083333333333335in"}

White has cross combined her black bishop (from QB1,1) with her
gold[]{.indexref
entry="gold:1 of 2 duke colored metal tiles, players start with one gold duke."}
duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} (from
KB1,1) onto a *gold-black stack* (K2,2) via a series of unspecified
moves. Either sub piece may make the final move to create a cross
combined stack. The free bishop (KB1,1) and duke (QB1,1) could also
cross combine, forming a *silver-white stack*. Occupied tiles have been
raised to reveal their duke colors.

### Intersecting Planes

To fully understood the stack, it is necessary to understand the
underlying geometry. In this case, the relevant geometry is how a set of
non-parallel planes intersect. A pair of planes will intersect in a
*single* line, three planes in *three* lines (rook), four planes in
*six* lines (bishop), etc.

Given N planes, there will be N(N-1)/2 intersection lines. For the 4
planes of the bishop that's (4\*3)/2 = 6 intersection lines. To double
check[]{.indexref
entry="double check:A piece moves to check the king but also discovers a check."},
note that a cube has 12 edges (the bishop edge rays) and each opposing
pair of edges define a line, 6 lines in total. Check.

However, it is possible for more than one pair of non-parallel planes to
intersect along the *same* line. For instance, each of the duke linear
moves occurs in three planes, so three pairs of duke planes intersect
along the same line. A cube has 8 corners (the duke vertex rays), so 4
intersection lines, but each must be counted thrice, for 12 intersection
lines. Using the formula for six planes, (6\*5)/2 = 15. Ahhh, each pair
of duke cross planes[]{.indexref
entry="cross planes:Duke planes come in planes connecting opposing board faces."}
also intersect. They intersect along one of 3 orthogonal lines. These
lines contain the duplex tiles in the face quadrants, the tiles that are
hotspot overlap tiles for the queen, 12 + 3 = 15. Check.

With that warmup, we can tackle how the four planes of the bishop
intersect with the six planes of the duke. That's 10 total planes,
(10\*9)/2 = 45. Bishop-to-bishop intersections account for 6, and
duke-to-duke intersections account for 15, leaving 24 bishop-to-duke
intersection lines to account for. Q-tiles lie along the linear moves of
the bishop, which occur along six lines, but there are two bishop planes
for each, so that's 12, leaving 12 intersection lines for the Feynman
tiles.

Feynman tiles alternate with bishop apex tiles. Since there is one
sequence of apex tiles per quadrant, six quadrants per skew plane and
four skew planes, that's twenty-four pairs of opposing apex tiles; 12
intersection lines. Check.

Table 8 below shows how each bishop plane intersects each duke plane.

The V-D and H-D annotations are a kind of double check[]{.indexref

that the plane intersections present a reasonable permutation pattern.
For the major and minor planes, this is obvious, but for others. a
double check[]{.indexref
entry="double check:A piece moves to check the king but also discovers a check."}
is warranted. The first letter applies to the Up/Down part of the plane

name. V means they match vertically in the table, Q to Q, and Feynman to
Feynman. H means they match horizontally, q-tile to Feynman tile. The D
means they match diagonally between the Q and Feynman tiles.

### Teleportation

Given that cross combinations are allowed, there is a special case of
such, where one sub piece starts on one stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."} and
[]{#teleport .anchor}*teleports* into another.[^30] Note that the
teleporting sub piece cannot change color; and the base
piece[]{.indexref
entry="base piece:A piece which moves along only 1 type of ray; rook, bishop, duke."}
must be on different []{#native_color .anchor}*native
colors*[]{.indexref
entry="native color:Teleportation relevant, white/black for bishops, gold/silver for dukes."}.[^31]

Figure 80 shows a duke teleport[]{.indexref
entry="teleport:A stack emits a sub piece onto a base piece of a different native color."}.

Teleportation violates two invariants in 2D chess; when a piece moves,
it leaves behind an empty tile[]{.indexref entry="âtile:Generic"}, and
must either convert another empty tile[]{.indexref
entry="âtile:Generic"} into an occupied tile[]{.indexref
entry="âtile:Generic"} or capture an opponent's piece. Note that like
recombination[]{.indexref entry="ârecombination:A"}, teleportation is a
strict move[]{.indexref entry="âstrict"}, it cannot achieve capture; a
pawn's advance has a similar restriction, advancing as a rook is a
strict move[]{.indexref entry="âstrict"}, capture is not allowed as a
rook, but must be done as a bishop (duke[]{.indexref entry="âduke:The"}
or bishop in 3D). Recombination only violated the first
invariant[]{.indexref entry="âinvariant:A"}, teleportation violates
both.

[]{#_Ref61448443 .anchor}Figure 80: Stack to Stack Teleportation of a

An original *white-gold stack* (Q5,1) *teleports* by emitting a duke
which combines with the existing black bishop (QR8,6) creating a
*gold-black stack*, one of the two possible *cross combined stacks* for
White. The teleporting sub piece (ghosted) does not change its color
(gold) but must teleport[]{.indexref

(white/black). The example shows the 5x5 advancement square in the
downleft plane; note the two tiles off the board. Occupied tiles have
been raised to reveal their duke colors.

Note that teleportation to duplex, apex or overlap tiles cannot occur,
for they are on the same native color.

An original *white-gold stack* (KR1,1) *teleports* by emitting a bishop
which combines with the existing silver duke (QN8,2) creating a
*silver-white stack*, one of the two possible *cross combined stacks*
for White. The teleporting sub piece (ghosted) does not change its color
(white) but must teleport[]{.indexref
entry="teleport:A stack emits a sub piece onto a base piece of a different native color."}
between two sub pieces (duke) that are on *different native
colors*[]{.indexref
entry="native color:Teleportation relevant, white/black for bishops, gold/silver for dukes."}
(gold/silver). The example shows the 7x7 advancement square in the
rightward plane; note the many tiles off the board, including two of the
three Feynman tiles. Since the bishop is the traveling piece, it has
been inverted with the duke in the stacks. Occupied tiles have been
raised to reveal their duke colors.

Both bishop and duke could move back, teleporting the stack again,
converting it from a cross-combined stack back into an original stack,
but the advancement squares would not fully overlap.

A questionable technique has been used to indicate bishop teleportation;
the stacking order of the bishop and duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} has been
reversed. This is a matter of style only. Given that we now have a
deeper understanding of duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} colors,
another possibility is to have the stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."} with
the gold[]{.indexref
entry="gold:1 of 2 duke colored metal tiles, players start with one gold duke."}
duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} on top,
silver[]{.indexref
entry="silver:1 of 2 duke colored metal tiles, players start with one silver duke."}
duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} on bottom.
One small benefit of this option is that it does serve to better
indicate that dukes across the starting lineup are on opposite
duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} colors. The
noise cost of this choice is questionable and is really a matter more of
invention[]{.indexref
entry="invention:Simple primitives chosen to lead to complex play."}
than discovery[]{.indexref
entry="discovery:Rules to 3D chess must be discovered, not invented."},
but if there are cases where it makes the tactical situation clearer, it
might find merit in special cases. It serves that purpose here, treating
bishop teleportation as a kind of special case.[^32] Your mileage may
vary.

### Explosion (Fission)

If you thought that variations on the stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."} move
could not be taken any further into the Twilight Zone, the
stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."} has
yet another surprise to tantalize us with.

Consider, just for the moment, if we let the stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."}
[]{#explode .anchor}*explode*[]{.indexref entry="explode:See fission."},
fission[]{.indexref
entry="fission:Stack separation where both bishop and duke advance to different tiles."}
like, in that *both* the bishop and the duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} may
advance; now to *two* destination tiles. Like teleportation, []{#fission
.anchor}*fission*[]{.indexref
entry="fission:Stack separation where both bishop and duke advance to different tiles."}
violates an invariant of 2D chess. It violates the "fill one empty
tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}"
invariant[]{.indexref
entry="invariant:A pattern which remains constant while other things change."}
as it can populate *two* empty tiles. Teleportation violated both the
"fill one empty tile" and the "leave one empty tile behind" invariants.
Decay violated only the "leave one empty tile behind" invariant; all
permutations accounted for.

But that is not its only possibility. It allows a whole new way to
fork[]{.indexref
entry="fork:Simultaneously attacking two or more pieces with one move."}
multiple pieces and an additional way to quark[]{.indexref
entry="quark:Refers to an attack that generally requires more than one piece to block."}
another piece. Even more dramatically, it further allows the capture of
*two* pieces at once. That is a lot of power to invest in one piece, but
it helps to justify the risk that when a stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."} is
captured it does in some sense actually amount to two pieces being
captured at once; at least the injured party might look at it that way.

Despite the invariant[]{.indexref
entry="invariant:A pattern which remains constant while other things change."}
violations, the choice has been made to allow this move, but with a
limiting restriction. The justification for this choice of restriction
does not arise naturally until the last chapter.[^33]

A stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."} may
explode[]{.indexref entry="explode:See fission."} (fission[]{.indexref
entry="fission:Stack separation where both bishop and duke advance to different tiles."})
only if the perimeters of the resulting advancement regions of the
bishop and duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} *share* an
overlap tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."};
either a q-tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
or a Feynman tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}.
Now, as promised, some justification for the weird choice of
'Feynman'[^34] as the name of the overlap tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
that connects bishop and duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} alone; the
allusion to physics is deeper in this game than is apparent from a first
exposure.

### The Precedence of Ambiguity

Recall that the most fundamental concept in the discovered rules of 3D
chess is the advancement square. In 2D, pieces move in lines, and they
have *two* directions in which they can move in each line. In 3D, pieces
move in planes, and they have *four* directions (*six* for the bishop)
in which they can move. These are the quadrant moves. However, quadrants
are bordered by straight lines. Linear moves are allowed, the game is
silly without them, but there are two ambiguities associated with linear
moves, which *quadrant* they moved in, and which plane they moved in.

The plane ambiguity is resolved via the concept that lines in 2D are
*independent*, thus planes in 3D should be independent, therefore pieces
which make *linear* moves do so in *every* unblocked plane. However, the
quadrant ambiguity was resolved such that *both* quadrants must be
unblocked for a linear move in that plane to be unblocked.

Again, we are faced with a rule degeneracy; which is more primary,
linear moves, or ambiguity? This will matter whenever a situation arises
in which the ambiguity is broken; in which a linear move must clearly be
occurring in only *one* of the quadrants. We will see this shortly for
the pawn.

But the breaking of the ambiguity occurs also for the stack; not for
decay, that's a pure base piece move, and not for any of the
re-combining moves, those are also pure base piece moves; but for
fission, the requirement that the advancement manifolds be conjoined by
an overlap tile breaks the ambiguity. A q-tile is already an end tile
for the bishop, so no problem, but it is an apex tile for the duke. A
Feynman tile is an apex tile for the bishop, but simultaneously also a
perimeter tile (non-end tile, non-duplex tile) for a duke. So, the
question is whether the end tiles of the advancement manifolds for a
fission move are allowed destinations. In other words, are fission moves
*pure quadrant*[]{.indexref
entry="pure quadrant:Quadrant move which does not include the end tiles."}
moves or *full quadrant*[]{.indexref
entry="full quadrant:Quadrant move which does include the end tiles."}
moves?

In stack decay, either a linear move or a quadrant move is selected, for
either the bishop or the duke; recombination, cross-combination, and
teleportation the same. In all those cases a linear move has quadrant
ambiguity, but a stack move requires the selection of an overlap tile
for which there is no quadrant ambiguity. The overlap tile breaks the
quadrant ambiguity. Therefore, the end tiles of the advancement squares
(but not the end tiles of the bishop advancement rectangles in q-tile
fission) should be allowed. This argument will be strengthened in the
last chapter.

Quadrant ambiguity is what leads to linear moves, it is a predicate to
them -- []{#ambiguity_is_ascendant .anchor}*ambiguity takes precedence*
over the linear move. That is why the previous figure shows full
quadrant[]{.indexref
entry="full quadrant:Quadrant move which does include the end tiles."}
moves for both sub pieces.

This has an interesting consequence. It is possible for an end tile to
be blocked in every plane, yet not in the quadrant containing the
overlap tile. Thus, in the previous figure, a Black piece on White's
KN4,4 tile, could potentially be captured with a fission move; even when
capture by decay was blocked.

### Fusion

Of course, if fission is allowed, then fusion cannot be far behind...or
so one would think. Turns out that time reversal in 3D chess comes with
nuances. These nuances arise naturally when piece to piece interactions
are considered, which happens in Part III. The presentation of the rules
for the stack fusion move will therefore be necessarily postponed until
we have developed a better understanding of reversibility in 3D chess.

### Chess Notation[]{.indexref entry="Chess Notation:Concise way to capture moves or a specific position."}

The stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."}
presents special challenges for chess notation, although indicating a
stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."} move
is straightforward, S -- Kn,m (Figure 72). Decay is not too bad either,
just prepend the letter S before the sub piece letter, SD -- KN5,1
(Figure 76). Recombination can be implied by the fact that the
destination tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
is occupied, but the same could be said for capture, yet it is clearer
to indicate that a capture has happened not just a move (B x P), so
something like this is to be preferred, B r D@Q8,6 (Figure 78). Replace
the 'r' with 'cr' for a cross recombination[]{.indexref
entry="recombination:A bishop or duke reconstituting a stack by moving onto the other."},
B cr D@Q2,2 (Figure 79). A similar technique works for teleportation, D
t QR8,8 (Figure 80 and Figure 81).

The real difficulty occurs for fissions and fusions. Let 'f' be the
conjoining letter, two tiles on the right imply fission[]{.indexref
entry="fission:Stack separation where both bishop and duke advance to different tiles."},
two tiles on the left implies fusion. Thus, S f B@Q5,6, D@K7,3 (Figure
83), and B@(Q5,4), D@(KB4,4) f S@(QR3,3). If the standard 'bishop first,
duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} second' is
employed these can be simplified, for instance fusion example becomes
Q5,4 KB4,4 f QR3,3.

A fission[]{.indexref
entry="fission:Stack separation where both bishop and duke advance to different tiles."}
can result in two captures, one capture, or none. For instance, S f BxN
& DxP can make perfect sense. A single capture perhaps like this, S f
DxR, B@K2,1. While bishop should precede duke in general, it seems
better to let capture be listed first and to let it trump bishop-duke
order when it is the duke which captured and the bishop which merely
moved.

A fusion can only capture one piece, thus, B, D fx QB, or with extreme
shorthand, BD fx QB.

### Shape

In part by fortunate coincidence the piece design of the bishop and
duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} make
stacking them easy; the bishop has a horizontal cross section that is
triangular, and both the top and bottom of the duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} have a
horizontal cross section that is triangular (in the middle the cross
section is hexagonal). This means that a tetrahedral cavity in the base
of both allows either to stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."}
comfortably on top of the other.

The duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} on top
looks more like a conventional bishop, so that is the preferred design
for the stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."}, but
the opposite order (bishop on top) may find some use; tactical,
aesthetic or both. Placing them side-by-side on a tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
is generally to be avoided, because it suggests that multiple pieces can
be in a tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
at the same time, a concept both wrong and in violation of the
one-tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
one-piece invariant[]{.indexref
entry="invariant:A pattern which remains constant while other things change."}.

However, for those who wish to create a board that is truly a cube,
equal size dimensions all around, there is a need to reduce the height
of the pieces just so they can fit between the levels; a side-by-side
placement of duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} and bishop
will achieve that for the stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."}. Use
your best judgement keeping in mind the long history and traditions of
classic chess. Perhaps there is a flatter piece design out there to be
invented.[^35]

Figure 84 shows the two possibilities, plus the cheat shape used for the
figures in this document. In this artistic cheat, the duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} and bishop
don't actually line up the way they would probably be manufactured, but
this subterfuge allows the two images to be separated into the sub
pieces such that the separated images are readily identifiable. This
avoids the need of having a separate shape for the stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."} and
saves a lot of cut and paste effort.

![[]{#_Ref61532163 .anchor}Figure 84: Stack
Shape](media/image85.png){alt="Shape, polygon Description automatically generated"
width="3.763888888888889in" height="4.916666666666667in"}

Preferred shape for the stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."} is
duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} on top
(upper left image) but for some cases, the reverse has merit (upper
right). Both can be real pieces with a tetrahedral cutout in the bases
that align with the outside surface. The image used in this work (lower
middle) is an artistic cheat that allows the duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} and bishop
images to be easily separated for reuse without a lot of cut and paste
effort. Duke-bishop rotation is 60 degrees[]{.indexref
entry="degrees:The degree of a trapdoor is the number of extra moves to retreat."}
around the vertical axis. Stack decorators are typically orange.

### Power Projection

The stack (and queen) have access to 3 Feynman tiles from the corner of
the board, and 12 from the center. For the q-tiles, its 9 from the
corner and 15 from the center.

Therefore, the stack, as a stack, can threaten 12 tiles from the corner
and 27 from the center for PPR[]{.indexref
entry="PPR:Power projection ratio, portion of the board reachable in 1 move."}'s
of 12/512 = 2.35% and 27/512 = 5.28%.

However, as a bishop or a duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."}, it is more
impressive. From the corner it can threaten 151 tiles, and from the
center 235 tiles. Therefore, the stack, as either a bishop or a duke,
has PPR[]{.indexref
entry="PPR:Power projection ratio, portion of the board reachable in 1 move."}'s
of 151/511 = 29.5% and 235/512 = 46.0%. Impressive, yes, but it's a one
shot, as the stack has to decay or fission to realize such a
PPR[]{.indexref
entry="PPR:Power projection ratio, portion of the board reachable in 1 move."},
and it's no longer a stack afterwards either.

The option to allow the stack to move *either* as a bishop (and carry
the duke) *or* as a duke (and carry the bishop) was rejected because it
allowed both the bishop and duke to change colors. Call this a
[]{#free_stack .anchor}*free stack*[]{.indexref
entry="free stack:Allows stack to move as either bishop or duke, carrying the other piece."}.
Its power is comparable to a rook and holds up better against the queen.
Under a free stack rule, decay, recombination, fission, and
teleportation would have to be revisited. Unless disallowed, the very
definition of bishop will have been changed, in effect no more stack,
and no free dukes.

A free stack and stack splitting by either decay or fission have the
same PPR.

### Review

The primary purpose of the stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."} is
to allow an 8x8x8 board without eliminating the duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} or changing
the starting lineup to be nonlinear (which also allowed dukes to move
prior to pawns and thus distorted openings). The stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."} is
an easy critique point, but in our judgement, it was the least offensive
of the options, and as we've gotten to know it, its 'chess-ness' starts
to shine through.

A stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."} is
allowed to move as a stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."}, but
only to overlap tiles[]{.indexref
entry="overlap tile:Tiles attackable as more than one base piece."} (Q
or Feynman tiles) and only if both the bishop and duke moves are legal.
If a stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."} is
captured prior to separating, both sub pieces (bishop & duke) are
captured and returned to the tray.

The stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."}
supports several unusual new types of moves not allowed of any other
piece. It can decay[]{.indexref
entry="decay:Just the bishop, or just the duke sub piece, separates from the stack."}
by emitting either a bishop or a duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."}, and a
bishop or a duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} may
recombine with either instance of the other piece, even if it is already
a part of a stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."}
(teleportation). Teleportation is a strict move[]{.indexref
entry="strict move:One that cannot capture, pawn advance, stack combine, teleportation."};
it cannot be used to capture another piece.

The stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."} also
admits of radically new types of moves, referred to as
fission[]{.indexref
entry="fission:Stack separation where both bishop and duke advance to different tiles."}
and fusion (inverse operators of each other). In fission[]{.indexref
entry="fission:Stack separation where both bishop and duke advance to different tiles."},
both sub pieces may simultaneously depart from the stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."}
leaving an empty tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
behind. This supports a new way to fork[]{.indexref
entry="fork:Simultaneously attacking two or more pieces with one move."}
multiple pieces and a new way to quark[]{.indexref
entry="quark:Refers to an attack that generally requires more than one piece to block."}
single pieces. In fusion, a bishop and a duke may move simultaneously
reconstituting a stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."}
which may result in a capture. Fission and fusion are restricted to be
conjoined[]{.indexref
entry="conjoined:Requirement that fission advancement manifolds share an overlap tile."}
by an overlap tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}.

All the new types of moves violate one or more of the move invariants of
2D chess. Some refinements to standard chess notation are required to
adequately communicate or record stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."}
moves.

A quick review of jargon. The basics of stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."}
moves; *sub pieces*, *overlap tiles*[]{.indexref
entry="overlap tile:Tiles attackable as more than one base piece."},
*q-tiles* and *Feynman tiles*. The single piece moves of
*decay*[]{.indexref
entry="decay:Just the bishop, or just the duke sub piece, separates from the stack."}
(which *emit*[]{.indexref
entry="emit:Stack decays by emitting either the bishop or the duke sub piece."}
a duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} or bishop,
and can result in capture), versus *recombination*[]{.indexref
entry="recombination:A bishop or duke reconstituting a stack by moving onto the other."},
*cross combination*[]{.indexref
entry="cross combination:Stack composed of a king side bishop and queen side duke (or reverse)."},
and *teleportation*, which are *strict* moves and cannot result in
capture. Recombination also led to a refined jargon for the type of
stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."} in
terms of its bishop and duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} colors;
*white-gold*[]{.indexref
entry="gold:1 of 2 duke colored metal tiles, players start with one gold duke."},
*black-silver*[]{.indexref
entry="silver:1 of 2 duke colored metal tiles, players start with one silver duke."}*,*
etc. The dual piece moves of *fission*[]{.indexref
entry="fission:Stack separation where both bishop and duke advance to different tiles."}
and *fusion*, and the restriction of such moves to be
*conjoined*[]{.indexref
entry="conjoined:Requirement that fission advancement manifolds share an overlap tile."}
by overlap tiles[]{.indexref
entry="overlap tile:Tiles attackable as more than one base piece."}.

## Pawn

The pawn is the most asymmetrical piece on the board. Unlike other
pieces it operates under peculiar restrictions, exceptions to these
restrictions, and has a superpower -- it can promote. Translating these
permutations to 3D is a non-trivial task, and much will be asked of the
Intrepid Reader in this chapter. But our goal is unchanged, play that
feels like chess.

### Three Restrictions

By cannon, the pawn can be defined in terms of the base pieces, but with
unique restrictions.

- Separation of advance and capture -- advances like rook, captures like
  the other base piece(s).

- Limited direction -- only towards promotion.

- Bounded range[]{.indexref
  entry="range:What percentage of the board a piece can eventually reach."}
  -- allowed only the smallest step possible[]{.indexref
  entry="smallest step possible:To perimeter 1, a sole tile in 2D, 3 quadrant tiles or 5 linear tiles in 3D."}.

If the 3D pawn can adhere to these handicaps[]{.indexref
entry="primary invariants:The restrictive pawn invariants of advance/capture, direction, & range."},
even with the complications of planar moves and advancement squares,
then we are one step closer in our quest for the *one right rule
set*[]{.indexref
entry="one right rule set:The thesis that there is just one right rule set for 3D chess."}.

#### Separation of Advance and Capture

The first restriction on the pawn is that it advances like a rook but
cannot capture as one; it is a *strict* move[]{.indexref
entry="strict move:One that cannot capture, pawn advance, stack combine, teleportation."}.
To capture an opposing piece, it must move like one of the other base
pieces. In 2D, this is just the bishop, but in 3D it may capture like
*either* a bishop or a duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."}.

[]{#_Toc210218259 .anchor}Congruent Rule : **The pawn advances like a
rook but captures like the other base pieces.**

#### Limited Direction

The second restriction on the pawn is limited direction. Direction is in
reference to where a pawn may promote -- the promotion tiles. For the
pawn, the *promotion line* is the opponent's home line. In 2D, these are
the 8 tiles on the opponent's home row. In 3D, these are the 8 tiles of
the opponent's home column. Both sets form one-dimensional lines. The
pawn must move towards the promotion line[]{.indexref
entry="promotion line:The home row/column of the opponentâs major pieces."}
in such a way as to *reduce*[]{.indexref
entry="reduces:Linear moves with one virtual quadrant reduce to full quadrants."}
the number of moves left to achieve promotion.

In 2D, six moves are required for a pawn to reach the promotion
line[]{.indexref
entry="promotion line:The home row/column of the opponentâs major pieces."}
(five if its first move is a double advance). Every advance, every
capture, brings the pawn closer to promotion. This is the practical
definition of 'direction;' it is this definition that will drive tactics
and strategy. In 3D, every advance, every capture, must bring the pawn
*closer* to promotion.

The challenge for 3D is that a perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} grows
(from a Euclidean perspective) in multiple directions at once; we will
have to *discover*[]{.indexref
entry="discover:A piece which when moved unblocks an attack from another piece."}
what 'direction' means for the pawn in 3D chess.

[]{#_Toc210218260 .anchor}Congruent Rule : **The pawn advances or
captures *toward* promotion.**

#### Bounded Range[]{.indexref entry="Range:What percentage of the board a piece can eventually reach."}

The third restriction on the pawn is a bounded range[]{.indexref
entry="range:What percentage of the board a piece can eventually reach."}.
In 2D, the pawn advances and captures in the *smallest step
possible*[]{.indexref
entry="smallest step possible:To perimeter 1, a sole tile in 2D, 3 quadrant tiles or 5 linear tiles in 3D."},
a single tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}.
In 3D, the smallest step possible[]{.indexref
entry="smallest step possible:To perimeter 1, a sole tile in 2D, 3 quadrant tiles or 5 linear tiles in 3D."}
is a move to perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} 1.
Therefore, in the context of the pawn, range[]{.indexref
entry="range:What percentage of the board a piece can eventually reach."}
will be regarded as the number of perimeters (the number of move steps),
even when it implies a larger Euclidean distance. Recall that the
perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} 1
apex[]{.indexref
entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."}
tiles of both bishop and duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} extend
beyond the 26 adjacent cubes; a larger Euclidean distance. It should be
clear that in the context of chess, *perimeter*[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} is the
measure of distance.

This definition applies equally to both quadrant and linear moves. If
the pawn is limited to perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} 1, then
the 3 tiles of the outer edge of a 2x2 advancement square[]{.indexref
entry="advancement square:An NxN advancement manifold, must be empty for a legal move."},
and the 5 tiles of the outer edge of a 2x3 advancement
rectangle[]{.indexref
entry="advancement rectangle:The advancement manifold for a linear move, both quadrants."},
are all equally 'distant' from the source tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}.

[]{#_Toc210218261 .anchor}Congruent Rule : **Pawns are limited to moving
to perimeter 1, with one exception.**

With this definition of range[]{.indexref
entry="range:What percentage of the board a piece can eventually reach."},
the bounded range[]{.indexref
entry="range:What percentage of the board a piece can eventually reach."}
restriction on the pawn advance and capture can be succinctly expressed
as, "a pawn may advance or capture only to perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} 1."

##### Double Advance

The pawn's rook advance has a special case, the double advance. On the
first move only, a pawn has the option of advancing twice as far. This
provides the pawn 5 moves on perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} 2 of a
3x3 advancement square[]{.indexref
entry="advancement square:An NxN advancement manifold, must be empty for a legal move."};
1 apex[]{.indexref
entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."}
tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
move, 2 pure quadrant[]{.indexref
entry="pure quadrant:Quadrant move which does not include the end tiles."}
moves[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant moves:A move into a quadrant, blocking is by an advancement square."},
and 2 end tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
moves.

[]{#_Toc210218262 .anchor}Congruent Rule : **On the first move only, a
pawn may double advance to perimeter**[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} **2.**

##### Dominant Planes

Call any line which contains one or more promotion tiles a *dominant
line*[]{.indexref
entry="dominant line:An orthogonal line which contains one or more promotion tiles."}.
There are 16 orthogonal lines on the 2D board; 8 files and 8 ranks. All
8 file lines include *one* promotion tile and are thus dominant lines.
In contrast, all but the last rank does include any at all, indeed the
last one includes all *eight* promotion tiles. Coincidently, they are
co-located with the opponent's home line. It too is a dominant line, the
only rank line that is, but containing all eight promotion tiles it
would seem to be even more dominant. Having already arrived along a file
line, however, this maximal dominance has no consequence on play.

Call any plane with one or more promotion tiles a *dominant
plane*[]{.indexref
entry="dominant plane:An orthogonal plane which contains one or more promotion tiles."}.
There are 24 orthogonal planes on the 3D board; 8 horizontal, 8
left-vertical, and 8 right-vertical. All 8 horizontal planes include
*one* promotion tile and are thus dominant planes. In contrast, all but
the last left and right vertical planes include any at all, indeed the
last pair, call them the *back planes* (1,8 & 8,1), include all *eight*
promotion tiles[]{.indexref
entry="promotion line:The home row/column of the opponentâs major pieces."}.
Unlike the 2D case they are not co-located with the opponent's home line
(planes versus lines). These two are also dominant planes, but
containing all eight promotion tiles they are even more dominant,
maximally so (8 promotion tiles versus 1). Unlike the 2D case, it is
possible for a pawn to arrive in a maximally dominant plane without
having landed on a promotion tile. This difference is going to require a
little more work to discover the right rules.

[]{#_Toc210218263 .anchor}Congruent Rule : **Pawns may advance only in a
dominant manifold.**

### Advances Like a Rook

In 2D, the pawn advances in dominant lines, in 3D it advances in
dominant planes.

Every advance reduces the number of moves required to achieve promotion.
In 2D, the pawn may only advance in one direction down its file line:
toward the opponent. In 3D, the pawn may only advance in one quadrant
down its horizontal plane: toward the opponent. This means advance only
in the forward quadrant, but should this be a pure quadrant move? Two of
the tiles in the advancement perimeter are end tiles, shared with the
side quadrants, which for a rook would be linear moves. However, the
linear move exists because it is ambiguous in which quadrant such moves
occur. In the case of the pawn, this ambiguity is absent since tiles in
the side quadrants do not reduce the number of moves required to reach
the promotion line[]{.indexref
entry="promotion line:The home row/column of the opponentâs major pieces."}.

Therefore, the pawn advances in its horizontal plane only in the forward
quadrant. It has no linear move in this plane. Pieces in the side
quadrants do not block the pawn's advance. Figure 85 shows two examples
of the pawn's rook-like advance in its horizontal plane, a double
advance to the second perimeter by White and a single advance to the
first perimeter by Black.

![[]{#_Ref185074473 .anchor}Figure 85: Pawn Advances Like a
Rook](media/image86.png){alt="A screenshot of a video game Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="1.7465277777777777in"}

Pawn advances like a rook with the end tiles included in the quadrant
move[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant move:A move into a quadrant, blocking is by an advancement square."}.
Two pawn advances are shown; an optional first move double advance to
perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} 2 by
White (a), and a first move single advance to perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} 1 by
Black (b). Pawn decorators are smaller than for the other pieces and
don't have a crisp black edge. Ghost pawns indicate legal moves. Note
that from the starting lineup, apex[]{.indexref
entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."}
tiles lie in the primary major plane[]{.indexref
entry="major plane:Duke vertical cross planes perpendicular to the players."},
but the pawn is not limited to staying in that plane and may advance off
the metal plane onto either adjacent gem plane[]{.indexref
entry="gem plane:Gem planes are vertical slant planes with only ruby & jade tiles."}
(or with a double advance, even to the next metal plane over). Recall
that the end tiles of the advancement square[]{.indexref
entry="advancement square:An NxN advancement manifold, must be empty for a legal move."}
are included in the quadrant perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."}; there
is no linear move[]{.indexref
entry="linear move:A move along end tiles, blocked by advancement rectangle(s)."}
for the pawn in the horizontal plane[]{.indexref
entry="horizontal plane:Rook plane that is horizontal (a level, constant Z-axis)."}.

### Promotion

Despite weak power projection the pawn has a superpower -- it can
*promote*[]{.indexref
entry="promote:Reaching the home column, a pawn upgrades to a more powerful piece."}.
Because of promotion a material advantage of just a single pawn is often
sufficient to win the game. 3D chess variants that do not meet this
criterion fail the smell test; without this property, evenly matched
games end in stalemate; 'doesn't feel like chess[]{.indexref
entry="feel like chess:Play in 3D must feel like chess, a one pawn advantage wins."}.'

While a single pawn is weak, it is not alone; half the pieces on the
board are pawns. What a single pawn can't do, a swarm of pawns can. A
line of pawns can offer an unbroken chain of defense that hems in the
opponent, restricting their motion and options, while allowing their own
major pieces free reign to develop[]{.indexref
entry="develop:Moving a piece so it is more effective."}, threaten or
harass the enemy, and maintain the initiative. A swarm of pawns can use
teamwork and sacrifice to catapult one of them to the promotion
line[]{.indexref
entry="promotion line:The home row/column of the opponentâs major pieces."}
and by promoting it to a queen (or when necessary a lessor piece),
completely upend the material advantage, turn the tide and change a
losing position into a winning one.

The closer a pawn gets to promotion, the greater a threat it becomes. A
pawn promotes when it reaches the []{#home_line .anchor}home
line[]{.indexref
entry="home line:Orthogonal line of the opponentâs starting line-up of the major pieces."}
of the opposing player; from each player's perspective that is on
tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
8 of every file in 2D (row), and on tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
8,8 of every level in 3D (column).

An alternative that needs to be considered is if promotion should be
allowed on either of the two vertical back planes, the back faces of the
board. The planar move was discovered by realizing that since the board
had been promoted by a dimension so should the moves; for completeness'
sake the possibility that the promotion line[]{.indexref
entry="promotion line:The home row/column of the opponentâs major pieces."}
of 2D should also be promoted by a dimension as well should be
addressed. These are after all maximally dominant planes, and in 2D,
promotion occurred in the one maximally dominant line.

Addressing this variation here will take us too far afield as it
intersects with other issues not yet covered and required days of
exploring game situations to definitively reject. The short answer is
that allowing promotion on the back planes make it almost impossible to
block a pawn, fractured pawn walls, and destroyed most endgames
considered 'pawn races.' It didn't feel like chess. Finally, as will be
shown shortly, there is a better use for the back planes.

A pawn may promote[]{.indexref
entry="promote:Reaching the home column, a pawn upgrades to a more powerful piece."}
to any other piece (except the king). Usually, it promotes to the queen
as she is the most powerful piece on the board, but in pathological
situations, this can result in stalemate which may only be avoided by
promoting to a less powerful piece. In 3D chess this means rook, bishop,
duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."},
stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."}[^36]
or knight. Lots of opportunities for chess puzzles[]{.indexref
entry="chess puzzles:Limited objective practice situations which stress chess principles"}
here.

**at the opponent's *home* *line***[]{.indexref
entry="home line:Orthogonal line of the opponentâs starting line-up of the major pieces."}**;
to any major piece except the king.**

#### Promotion Molasses

It should be clear that a pawn can promote[]{.indexref
entry="promote:Reaching the home column, a pawn upgrades to a more powerful piece."}
in 6 moves if all its moves are single advances to apex[]{.indexref
entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."}
tiles. If it advances to an end tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."},
it leaves the metal plane and arrives on a gem plane[]{.indexref
entry="gem plane:Gem planes are vertical slant planes with only ruby & jade tiles."},
where it still takes 6 more moves to promote[]{.indexref
entry="promote:Reaching the home column, a pawn upgrades to a more powerful piece."}.
Wait, wasn't it a requirement that a pawn advance *toward* promotion?
Counter intuitively, advances to end tiles are allowed because such
moves actually reduce the promotion distance by, wait for it, *half a
move*[]{.indexref
entry="half a move:Pawn moves off the primary plane still reduce the promotion distance."}.

If a pawn advances first to a left end tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."},
then to a right end tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
(or vice-a-versa) it ends up on an apex[]{.indexref
entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."}
tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."},
one move closer to promotion. It took *two* advances to reduce the
distance to promotion by *one* move; thus, each advance shortened the
promotion distance by half a move[]{.indexref
entry="half a move:Pawn moves off the primary plane still reduce the promotion distance."}.

A pawn in the horizontal plane[]{.indexref
entry="horizontal plane:Rook plane that is horizontal (a level, constant Z-axis)."},
which starts with a single advance and makes no advances to
apex[]{.indexref
entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."}
tiles, will require *twelve* moves to promote[]{.indexref
entry="promote:Reaching the home column, a pawn upgrades to a more powerful piece."};
this dire situation is called *promotion molasses*[]{.indexref
entry="promotion molasses:Without apex moves, pawns can require 12 moves to promote."}*.*

Figure 86 shows increasing amounts of promotion molasses[]{.indexref
entry="promotion molasses:Without apex moves, pawns can require 12 moves to promote."}.
The routes shown are pure advances, no captures. Each pawn (one on every
level) starts on tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
2,2. Each promotes to a major piece on tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
8,8. All of the promotion possibilities including queen, the other base
pieces, the stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."}, and
also the knight are shown, as ghost images. The more valuable pieces are
shown at higher levels. Non apex[]{.indexref
entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."}
tiles decrease promotion distance by half a move[]{.indexref
entry="half a move:Pawn moves off the primary plane still reduce the promotion distance."},
so to account for the requirement of whole moves, every left end
tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
will have a matching right end tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}.
Examples of 12 moves to promotion are shown in (f) & (g).

tiles.

#### Shackled Pawns

However, *why* pawns have a bounded range[]{.indexref
entry="range:What percentage of the board a piece can eventually reach."}
has not been explored; more discovery[]{.indexref
entry="discovery:Rules to 3D chess must be discovered, not invented."}
awaits.

Consider what a pawn advance could look like in the back
planes[]{.indexref
entry="back planes:The pair of vertical planes which intersect at the pawn promotion line."}.
Think of the direction restriction as a *pull* by the promotion tiles
upon the pawn. Should the strength of this pull influence the
range[]{.indexref
entry="range:What percentage of the board a piece can eventually reach."},
or should the range[]{.indexref
entry="range:What percentage of the board a piece can eventually reach."}
be restricted to perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} 1 only?
There is no difference in 2D.

Once again, we are faced with a conceptual degeneracy[]{.indexref
entry="conceptual degeneracy:Two descriptions only equivalent at a lower level of abstraction."}
and have to decide which invariant[]{.indexref
entry="invariant:A pattern which remains constant while other things change."}
is more fundamental; both are dimension agnostic[]{.indexref
entry="dimension agnostic:Rules of chess which scale to higher dimensions as invariants."},
so that criterion won't help.

The different invariant, a *soft* invariant, that[]{.indexref
entry="invariant:A pattern which remains constant while other things change."}
of the medieval motif can help here. Think of the pawn as a peasant, an
indentured servant, *shackled*[]{.indexref
entry="shackled:Pawn range is limited by the number of promotion tiles in the manifold."}
even, which is why this piece has limited range[]{.indexref
entry="range:What percentage of the board a piece can eventually reach."}.
He dreams of becoming something more, so the pull of promotion is
strong, which is why the pawn only heads towards promotion.

Promotion in back planes[]{.indexref
entry="back planes:The pair of vertical planes which intersect at the pawn promotion line."}
is not viable (doesn't feel like chess), but they do contain promotion
tiles, 1/8^th^ of the tiles in each back plane is in fact a promotion
tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."},
same ratio as for files in 2D. Therefore, some kind of *partial
promotion*[]{.indexref
entry="partial promotion:The idea that back planes should aid in pawn promotion."}
seems appropriate.

Let a pawn which reaches a back plane become *unshackled*; it is free to
move in the back plane because it is a dominant plane[]{.indexref
entry="dominant plane:An orthogonal plane which contains one or more promotion tiles."},
however, there are more promotion tiles in this plane, so let its
range[]{.indexref
entry="range:What percentage of the board a piece can eventually reach."}
grow to match their number, 8. A pawn in the vertical back plane is
unshackled and may therefore advance toward promotion exactly as a
full-fledged rook. It may help to think of the number of promotion tiles
in a plane as *pull force*[]{.indexref
entry="pull force:The number of promotion tiles is as a pull force increasing pawn range."};
the horizontal planes have only *one* pull tile, but the vertical back
planes[]{.indexref
entry="back planes:The pair of vertical planes which intersect at the pawn promotion line."}
have *eight* pull tiles. An unshackled pawn is no longer restricted by a
bounded range. Its direction, however, is still restricted toward
promotion.

If blocked in the back plane, the pawn may still advance in the
horizontal plane[]{.indexref
entry="horizontal plane:Rook plane that is horizontal (a level, constant Z-axis)."},
but the range[]{.indexref
entry="range:What percentage of the board a piece can eventually reach."}
restriction remains in effect in that plane (it still has only one
promotion tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}).

In 2D, the vertical line (file) contains just one promotion
tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."},
so the 2D pawn may advance like a rook only one square.

[]{#_Toc210218265 .anchor}Congruent Rule : **The range of a
shackled**[]{.indexref
entry="shackled:Pawn range is limited by the number of promotion tiles in the manifold."}
**pawn is the number of promotion tiles in its manifold.**

Figure 87(a) shows an unshackled pawn (KB6,8) in the right back plane
advancing in either a quadrant move[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant move:A move into a quadrant, blocking is by an advancement square."}
to perimeter 2 in either of two 3x3 advancement squares or advancing in
a linear move[]{.indexref

to the promotion line[]{.indexref
entry="promotion line:The home row/column of the opponentâs major pieces."}
as a 3x5 advancement rectangle[]{.indexref
entry="advancement rectangle:The advancement manifold for a linear move, both quadrants."}.
It even shows two quadrant advances in the 3x3 advancement squares that
fall short of promotion, (KR7,8 & Q7,8). Figure 87(b) shows an
unshackled pawn whose linear move to QN8,5 is blocked in the left back
plane by Black's knight, but still able to advance to
perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} 1 in
the horizontal plane to this same tile[]{.indexref
entry="horizontal plane:Rook plane that is horizontal (a level, constant Z-axis)."}.
Alternatively, it could advance in the left back plane to Q8,6, changing
levels.

![[]{#_Ref185434196 .anchor}Figure 87: Pawns

restriction. Decorators indicate tiles which could block[]{.indexref
entry="block:Blocks cover, prevents a piece from moving to a desired location."}
such moves, ghost pawns indicate legal moves. The queen side pawn
(QN8,5) is also unshackled, but it is blocked in the left back plane by
Black's knight (b). It may still make a perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} 1
advance in the horizontal plane[]{.indexref
entry="horizontal plane:Rook plane that is horizontal (a level, constant Z-axis)."}.
Normally, this would be a linear move[]{.indexref
entry="linear move:A move along end tiles, blocked by advancement rectangle(s)."},
but the right quadrant is virtual (dimmed decorators), and the left
quadrant is off the board, so as a practical matter this is a
*direct*[]{.indexref
entry="direct:Linear moves with two virtual quadrants reduce to a single end tile."}
move and thus unblockable. The ghost pawn indicates the legal move.

Promotion molasses is a significant deviation from 2D behavior, it
greatly reduces[]{.indexref
entry="reduces:Linear moves with one virtual quadrant reduce to full quadrants."}
the threat of promotion, further eroding the influence of pawns in the
game. It also penalizes pawns for deviating from the primary
plane[]{.indexref
entry="primary plane:Largest major plane, contains starting lineup & promotion tiles."},
limiting their ability to form a pawn wall[]{.indexref
entry="pawn wall:Cooperating interconnected set of pawns which hamper development."}

entry="cleave:To separate the board into disjoint regions."} a
three-dimensional space with little more than a fat line.

to 3D chess; they give the back planes[]{.indexref
entry="back planes:The pair of vertical planes which intersect at the pawn promotion line."}
significance. They solve the promotion molasses[]{.indexref
entry="promotion molasses:Without apex moves, pawns can require 12 moves to promote."}
problem; even without any apex[]{.indexref
entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."}
advances at all, a pawn might still promote[]{.indexref
entry="promote:Reaching the home column, a pawn upgrades to a more powerful piece."}
in just 7 moves, 6 after a double advance. Now advancing off the primary
plane[]{.indexref
entry="primary plane:Largest major plane, contains starting lineup & promotion tiles."},
even way off, need cost only a single move. An unshackled pawn can
change levels even without capturing.

The strategy of the opening is to control the center and hem[]{.indexref
entry="hem:Restricting a kingâs options by blocking potential moves."}
in the opponent. It is harder to do both in 3D, but with the
range[]{.indexref
entry="range:What percentage of the board a piece can eventually reach."}
limit lifted in the back planes[]{.indexref
entry="back planes:The pair of vertical planes which intersect at the pawn promotion line."},
there is a strategic pull on the pawns to widen out. This has a positive
effect on openings, midgame[]{.indexref
entry="midgame:The middle part of the game where gambits rule."}, and
endgame, richer gambits and deeper strategies.

#### Promotion Distance

Whether an adjacent tile is closer to promotion or not depends on the
change in the number of moves required to reach the promotion
line[]{.indexref
entry="promotion line:The home row/column of the opponentâs major pieces."}.
This change can be plus one, minus one, or zero. Unshackled pawns
complicate the matter but are easy to reject. If promotion distance
includes unshackled pawns making full advances in a back plane, then an
off-axis pawn could make a linear advance toward the closer back plane,
or even an apex-move in the closer side quadrant and be closer to
promotion. This would make legal moves position dependent and
unsymmetric. Symmetric moves and position independence are fundamental
invariants in 2D chess applicable to all pieces.

Promotion distance shall therefore be determined by the number of single
advances required to reach a promotion tile moving only in a minimally
dominant manifold.

[]{#_Toc210218266 .anchor}Congruent Rule : **Promotion distance is the
minimum number of pawn single advances required in a minimally dominant
manifold.**

### Captures like One of the Other Base Pieces

In 2D, a pawn captures like a bishop. In 3D, a pawn captures like either
a bishop or a duke. If only that was the extent of the differences. It
is a nontrivial matter to *discover*[]{.indexref
entry="discover:A piece which when moved unblocks an attack from another piece."}
the right rule, to keep it consistent between advance and capture, to
keep it consistent between bishop captures and duke captures, and to
keep it as position independent as possible. A lot is about to be asked
of the reader. The 3D pawn is not a simple piece.

A non-edge square on the 2D board has 4 adjacent squares connected by
corners; 2 corners approach promotion, 2 recede. A pawn may capture
along any of the *two* diagonal lines, but only in the direction of
promotion.

A non-edge cube on the 3D board has 12 adjacent cubes connected by
edges; 5 edges approach promotion, 7 recede. A pawn may capture as a
bishop within any of the *four* skew planes, but only in the direction
of promotion.

A non-edge cube on the 3D board has 8 adjacent cubes connected by
vertices; 2 vertices approach promotion, 6 recede. A pawn may capture as
a duke within any of the *six* slant planes, but only in the direction
of promotion.

Despite the preceding symmetries, this is harder than it looks. Each
*diagonal line* has only *two* directions, one approaches promotion, one
recedes. In contrast, each *skew plane* has *six* quadrants, and each
*slant plane* has *four*. For some quadrants all its tiles approach
promotion, for others all its tiles recede, and for a pathological few
it is a mixture.

While it is clear if a tile is closer to promotion, it is less clear if
a quadrant is closer. For that we need an abstraction.

#### Virtual Quadrants

Let the direction restriction apply to the pawn on a
quadrant-by-quadrant basis. A quadrant with *any* tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
which recedes from promotion will be called a *virtual
quadrant*[]{.indexref
entry="virtual quadrant:Any pawn quadrant with tiles further from promotion."}.
If a linear move[]{.indexref
entry="linear move:A move along end tiles, blocked by advancement rectangle(s)."}
has one virtual and one non-virtual quadrant[]{.indexref
entry="virtual quadrant:Any pawn quadrant with tiles further from promotion."},
it *reduces*[]{.indexref
entry="reduces:Linear moves with one virtual quadrant reduce to full quadrants."}
to just the non-virtual quadrant[]{.indexref
entry="virtual quadrant:Any pawn quadrant with tiles further from promotion."},
moves to its end tiles shall be regarded as full quadrant[]{.indexref
entry="full quadrant:Quadrant move which does include the end tiles."}
moves[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant moves:A move into a quadrant, blocking is by an advancement square."}
rather than as linear moves. If the end tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
of a linear move[]{.indexref
entry="linear move:A move along end tiles, blocked by advancement rectangle(s)."}
has two virtual quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}
but does not itself recede from promotion, it shall be called a
*direct*[]{.indexref
entry="direct:Linear moves with two virtual quadrants reduce to a single end tile."}
tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
and moves to it cannot be blocked[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}.

[]{#_Toc210218267 .anchor}Congruent Rule : **For pawns, a quadrant with
*any* tiles farther from promotion is *virtual*.**

This definition applies to the rook as well, a conceptual extension
previously ignored.

[]{#_Toc210218268 .anchor}Congruent Rule : **A virtual component
reduces**[]{.indexref
entry="reduces:Linear moves with one virtual quadrant reduce to full quadrants."}
**a compound advancement manifold to a simple one.**

The previous congruent rule is 100% degenerate in 2D, equivalent to a
*null rule*[]{.indexref
entry="null rule:A rule in some abstraction which has no effect and can be dropped."}.
It finds meaning only in 3D chess and higher.

Both advance and capture in virtual quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="virtual quadrant:Any pawn quadrant with tiles further from promotion."}
are prohibited. Pieces on the tiles of a virtual quadrant[]{.indexref
entry="virtual quadrant:Any pawn quadrant with tiles further from promotion."}
do not block[]{.indexref
entry="block:Blocks cover, prevents a piece from moving to a desired location."}
a linear move[]{.indexref
entry="linear move:A move along end tiles, blocked by advancement rectangle(s)."},
they are like the tiles of an advancement rectangle that extend off the
board.

[]{#_Toc210218269 .anchor}Congruent Rule : **Virtual
quadrants**[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}
**do not block**[]{.indexref
entry="block:Blocks cover, prevents a piece from moving to a desired location."}**.**

Whether a quadrant is virtual or not depends on the number of moves
required to reach the promotion line[]{.indexref
entry="promotion line:The home row/column of the opponentâs major pieces."}
from each tile in that quadrant. There are several ambiguities here;
does the tile have to *reduce* the number of moves to be *legal*, or
does it have to *increase* the number of moves to be *illegal*. The
border between these two specifications are those tiles that *don't
change* the promotion distance. We have chosen the least restrictive
option, but it remains to be seen if this choice was discovery or
invention.

Virtual quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}
are always defined as if the pawn were in the primary plane[]{.indexref
entry="primary plane:Largest major plane, contains starting lineup & promotion tiles."},
otherwise they are position dependent and it gets *extremely* difficult
to visualize the changing legal moves. This is a *balance rule* to
facilitate play. In full transparency, it can be argued that it deviates
from our commitment to discovery, but the alternative consistently led
to mistakes where neither player caught that an illegal move had
occurred.

#### Invariants

When a 2D pawn captures it changes *one* file, advances *one* tile
closer to promotion, lands on an *adjacent* tile, and *cannot capture a
piece on a tile which it can advance to* as a rook. These invariants are
not fundamental, they are consequences of the fundamental rules, but one
of the surprises of 3D pawn captures is that they violate them. One can
think of them as *coincidental* or *derivative* invariants. They shall
be called out as we uncover them but shall be dealt with as a group
later.

### Captures Like a Bishop

Of the five edges that approach promotion, two are one level above the
pawn, two are one level below the pawn, and the fifth lies diagonally
directly in front of the pawn -- which is also the apex tile of its rook
advance. The above and below edge tiles are each a part of two planes:
one forward one outward. In the forward planes, only one quadrant is
non-virtual; it leans in the promotion direction. In the outward planes,
two quadrants are non-virtual, which are adjacent. They define a linear
move to the same tile, the edge tile directly in front of the pawn (the
rook apex tile). There are, therefore, only 6 non virtual quadrants, out
of 24.

Figure 88 shows the tiles on perimeter 1 for a pawn on KB3,3 for both
*forward* planes. Tiles in virtual quadrants are dimmed. Out of the 12
quadrants in these two planes only 2 are non-virtual; they are the
upward quadrant in the upward plane and the downward quadrant in the
downward plane.

![[]{#_Ref185516484 .anchor}Figure 88: Pawn Bishop Virtual Quadrants in
Forward
Planes](media/image89.png){alt="A picture containing text Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="3.936111111111111in"}

All the perimeter 1 tiles of the pawn's bishop attack in the forward
planes are shown for a White pawn on KB3,3. In each plane, 5 of the 6
quadrants are virtual. Tiles in virtual quadrants are dimmed. Note there
are 12 apex tiles; 10 dimmed and 2 not, and 10 edge tiles, 6 dimmed and
4 not, which are the linear tiles of advancement rectangles reduced to
advancement squares (KN & K levels).

Figure 89 shows the tiles on perimeter 1 for a pawn on KB3,3 for both
*outward* planes. Tiles in virtual quadrants are dimmed. Out of the 12
quadrants in these two planes only 4 are non-virtual; they are the pair
of forward quadrants pointed toward the opponent in both outward planes.

![[]{#_Ref185516501 .anchor}Figure 89: Pawn Bishop Virtual Quadrants in
Outward
Planes](media/image90.png){alt="A picture containing text, checker Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="3.936111111111111in"}

All the perimeter 1 tiles of the pawn's bishop attack in the outwards
planes are shown for a White pawn on KB3,3. In each plane, 4 of the 6
quadrants are virtual. Tiles in virtual quadrants are dimmed. Note there
are 12 apex tiles; 8 dimmed and 4 not and 10 edge tiles, 5 dimmed and 5
not dimmed. The four which are linear tiles of advancement rectangles
reduced to advancement squares are on the KN & K levels. The fifth is a
true linear move in two planes with two advancement rectangles (KB4,4)
which is also a brook tile and thus the decorator sports a small red
diamond.

The pair of previous figures will frame the discussion of the pawn's
legal bishop captures. The next four figures expand upon them but with
all the virtual tiles suppressed. Pawn capture tiles will be assigned
names. A hyperlinked summary of those names is in the [Table of Pawn
Capture Tiles](#table-of-pawn-capture-tiles) in the Glossary Table
Appendix III.

The pawn has three ways to capture as a bishop; quadrant moves in one
advancement square (6 tiles), reduced linear moves in two independent
advancement squares (4 tiles), and one full linear move in two
independent advancement rectangles (1 tile). The pawn therefore
threatens 11 tiles via her bishop capture move, one of which she can
advance to as a rook. This violates a 2D derivative invariant.

#### Quadrant Captures (Predator & Sling)

The pawn can attack 6 bishop apex tiles. Each is at the tip of a 2x2
advancement square and are thus quadrant moves.

Figure 90 shows the two pure quadrant[]{.indexref
entry="pure quadrant:Quadrant move which does not include the end tiles."}
captures by the pawn as a bishop in the forward planes. The two 2x2
advancement squares share the source tile. Ghost pawns indicate the
legal moves. These are captures to apex tiles and occur *two* levels up
or down, which violate a 2D derivative invariant[]{.indexref
entry="derivative invariants:Pawn invariants with tactical but not strategic implications."}.
This is called a *predator capture*[]{.indexref
entry="predator capture:Pawn capture to a bishop apex tile two levels away."}
(think apex predators).

![[]{#_Ref185517634 .anchor}Figure 90: Pawn Bishop Quadrant Capture in
Forward Planes
(Predator)](media/image91.png){alt="A picture containing text, checker Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="3.936111111111111in"}

The two 2x2 advancement squares for the two predator captures are shown.
These are moves to apex tiles. Ghost pawns show the legal moves. While
these are captures *two* levels away (above and below), they only
advance the pawn *one* move toward promotion.

Note that for predator captures the metallicity of the pawn does not
change and they bring the pawn exactly one move closer to promotion.

Figure 91 shows the four reduced linear captures by the pawn as a bishop
in the outward planes. The four 2x2 advancement squares share both the
source tile and the end tile directly in front of the pawn. A piece on
that end tile blocks all four captures. Ghost pawns indicate the legal
moves. These are also captures to apex tiles but get the pawn *one and
half moves* closer to promotion, violating another 2D derivative
invariant. This is called a *sling capture*[]{.indexref
entry="sling capture:Pawn capture to a bishop apex tile one level away."}
(think slinging around the primary plane). Two such captures in opposite
outward planes get the pawn three moves closer to promotion in just two
moves. The combination which gets the pawn closer to promotion by three
moves is called a *slingshot*[]{.indexref
entry="slingshot:Two sling captures which reduce the promotion distance by 3 moves."}
gambit[]{.indexref
entry="gambit:Standard sequence of moves with a well establish purpose or outcome."}.

![[]{#_Ref185521592 .anchor}Figure 91: Pawn Bishop Quadrant Capture in
Outward Planes
(Sling)](media/image92.png){alt="A picture containing text, checker Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="3.936111111111111in"}

The four 2x2 advancement squares for the four sling captures (one level
above and one level below) are shown. These are also moves to apex tiles
but change the metallicity of the pawn and bring it one and half moves
closer to promotion. Ghost pawns show the legal moves.

Unlike predator captures, sling captures *do* change the pawn's
metallicity.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  A pawn which makes a double first advance to the apex tile and then captures two
  opposing pieces with a slingshot[]{.indexref
  entry="slingshot:Two sling captures which reduce the promotion distance by 3 moves."}
  is just *one* move away from promotion. This is *one move faster* than what is possible
  in 2D chess, violating yet another derivative invariant. Despite promotion molasses,
  chess in three dimensions, with planar moves and advancement squares, develops just as
  fast as in 2D chess; in special cases, even faster.

#### Reduced Linear Captures (Reduced)

In 2D chess, the visualization challenge came down visualizing lines,
each with two directions. In 3D chess, the visualization challenge
increases in several ways. First of course is visualizing planes, then
quadrants in that plane (four or six). A linear move requires
visualizing two quadrants (essentially half a plane, or a third for the
bishop) but simultaneously in two planes (three for the duke). With pawn
captures, the visualization challenge increases even more; reduced
linear moves have only one of the expected pairs of quadrants, which
requires visualizing two advancement squares that are in different
planes but nonetheless intersect along a line.

Figure 92 shows the two 2x2 advancement squares for a pawn making a
reduced linear capture as a bishop which share the source tile and the
edge tile. In this example the reduced linear move is in the
intersection of the upward and leftward planes. The ghost pawn indicates
the legal move. This is a capture to an edge tile; a reduced linear move
as one quadrant in each plane is virtual. This is called a *reduced
capture*[]{.indexref
entry="reduced capture:Pawn capture to a bishop edge tile one level away."}.

Upward & Leftward Planes
(Reduced)](media/image93.png){alt="A picture containing text, checker Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="3.936111111111111in"}

The two 2x2 advancement squares (reduced advancement rectangles), which
are in different planes, are shown for the pawn's bishop reduced linear
capture. The ghost pawn shows the legal move. This is a change in
metallicity and advances the pawn toward promotion by only half a move.
Like the rook advance to an end tile, this violates a 2D derived
invariant.

Figure 93 shows the same situation but in the downward plane.

![[]{#_Ref185518698 .anchor}Figure 93: Pawn Bishop Linear Capture in
Downward & Leftward Planes
(Reduced)](media/image94.png){alt="A screenshot of a video game Description automatically generated with low confidence"
width="6.5in" height="3.936111111111111in"}

Mirror situation of the previous figure. The two 2x2 advancement
squares, which are in different planes (still the leftward plane, but
now in the downward plane) are shown for the pawn's bishop reduced
linear capture. The ghost pawn shows the legal move.

The pawn advances only half a move toward promotion but like the sling
capture[]{.indexref
entry="sling capture:Pawn capture to a bishop apex tile one level away."}
changes metallicities. A pair of pieces, one in each quadrant of the two
intersection planes, is required to block[]{.indexref
entry="block:Blocks cover, prevents a piece from moving to a desired location."}
the linear move[]{.indexref
entry="linear move:A move along end tiles, blocked by advancement rectangle(s)."},
even though the advancement rectangles have been reduced.

Part of the visualization challenge for the pawn is that all the
advancement squares are 2x2; large planes are easier to see and their
line of intersection more obvious.

Figure 94 shows both reduced linear captures in the rightward plane; one
in the upward plane and another in the downward plane. Ghost pawns
indicate the legal moves. In examples like this, the visualization task
is to mentally separate the pairs of planes involved in multiple linear
moves.

![[]{#_Ref185518710 .anchor}Figure 94: Pawn Bishop Reduced Linear
Capture in Forward & Rightward Planes
(Reduced)](media/image95.png){alt="A picture containing text, checker Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="3.936111111111111in"}

In this figure, both reduced linear captures in the rightward plane are
shown; one in the upward plane, the other in the downward plane. Each
move has two 2x2 advancement squares, which are in different planes.
Ghost pawns show the legal moves. Note that a piece on the brook tile
directly in front of the pawn (red insert in the tile decorator) blocks
both moves only in the outward plane. Attack may still be possible in
the relevant forward plane.

All the reduced captures change the pawn's metallicity and advance it
toward promotion by half a move.

#### Full Linear Capture (Bead)

The pawn has only one bishop capture that is a full linear move, with
two advancement rectangles (2x3) in a pair of intersection planes
(outward planes).

Figure 95 shows the one and only full linear capture the pawn is capable
of. It is a linear move in the two outward planes to a brook tile. Note
the red insert in the decorator. At first glance this is a disturbing
move, for the pawn is being allowed to capture in a rook plane, to a
tile it can normally advance to. This is a capture in the dominant plane
(the horizontal level). It is a Bishop Edge Attack in the Dominant plane
(BEAD) so this is called a *bead*[]{.indexref
entry="bead:Pawn capture as a linear bishop move diagonally in front."}
*capture*, in reference to the fact that it occurs in the dominant
plane. Or, if you will, consider it as an allusion to a hunter who gets
a *bead* on his target.

![[]{#_Ref185519274 .anchor}Figure 95: Pawn Bishop Linear Capture in the
Outward Planes
(Bead)](media/image96.png){alt="A picture containing text, checker Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="3.936111111111111in"}

The pair of 2x3 advancement rectangles are shown for the pawn's one and
only fully linear capture. This is a bishop capture in the outward
planes. The ghost pawn shows the legal move. Either the leftward or the
rightward plane must be unblocked. Like the dart capture as a duke, this
is a capture to a tile on the pawn's level, a horizontal plane, a rook
plane, the pawn's dominant plane. It is called the *bead*[]{.indexref
entry="bead:Pawn capture as a linear bishop move diagonally in front."}
tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."},
in allusion to the dominant plane[]{.indexref
entry="dominant plane:An orthogonal plane which contains one or more promotion tiles."}.
Metallicity is unchanged, and the pawn advances toward promotion by
exactly one move.

Like predator captures, this move preserves the pawn's metallicity and
advances it toward promotion by exactly one move. However, it also means
that two opposing pawns on the same level might not block[]{.indexref
entry="block:Blocks cover, prevents a piece from moving to a desired location."}
each other but can actually place each other under attack. Two more 2D
derivative invariants violated.

### Captures Like a Duke

Of the 8 adjacent cubes connected by corners, 6 recede from promotion,
thus any quadrant they are a part of is automatically virtual. This
leaves only one quadrant (out of 24) that is non virtual, the forward
quadrant of the major plane. This is similar to the rook, where the
forward quadrant in the horizontal plane[]{.indexref
entry="major plane:Duke vertical cross planes perpendicular to the players."}
was the only non-virtual quadrant[]{.indexref
entry="virtual quadrant:Any pawn quadrant with tiles further from promotion."}
(1 out of 12). It's going to take four figures to see this clearly; in
all of them the focus is on the White KB pawn advanced to KB3,3, five
moves away from promotion.

Figure 96 shows the minor plane for a pawn on the KB3,3 tile out to
perimeter 1. Not a single tile advances toward promotion; all four
quadrants are virtual. The pawn has no legal capture in this plane.

![[]{#_Ref185583195 .anchor}Figure 96: Pawn Duke Minor Plane -- All
Tiles Fail to Advance Toward
Promotion](media/image97.png){alt="A picture containing text Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="3.936111111111111in"}

All the quadrants in the minor plane are virtual; half the tiles recede
from promotion (the corner tiles) and half fail to approach promotion
(the apex and duplex tiles). The pawn has no legal captures in this
plane. Note that all decorators are dimmed.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------
  Caveat: if the pawn's position shifts diagonally left or right
  two tiles (from the players' perspectives) then the end and apex
  tiles in either the right or left quadrant respectively,
  technically advance toward promotion, rendering the quadrant non
  virtual. This would make the pawn duke capture position dependent
  and unsymmetric, violating a pair of 2D invariants that apply to
  all pieces. Thus, the pawn is denied a duke capture in the minor
  plane even when off axis.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------

#### Quadrant Captures (Dart)

Figure 97 shows the major plane for a pawn on the KB3,3 tile out to
perimeter 1. All 8 tiles in perimeter 1 are shown. Those that recede
from promotion are dimmed (three of them). The two duplex tiles (two
levels up and down) are also dimmed as while they do not recede from
promotion, neither do they advance toward promotion, but in either case
they are part of a virtual quadrant[]{.indexref
entry="virtual quadrant:Any pawn quadrant with tiles further from promotion."}.
Thus, three of the four quadrants in this plane have tiles which recede
from promotion and are therefore virtual. Capture is allowed only in the
forward quadrant, and as the other three quadrants are virtual, there is
no ambiguity about which quadrant a move is in, so both end tiles are
included (one level up and one level down).

![[]{#_Ref185583157 .anchor}Figure 97: Pawn Duke Apex Capture in Primary
Plane
(Dart)](media/image98.png){alt="A picture containing text, checker Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="3.936111111111111in"}

The 8 tiles of perimeter 1 of the major plane are shown for a pawn at
KB3,3. Three tiles recede from promotion and two fail to advance toward
promotion, so three of the four quadrants are virtual. Limiting the
pawn's ability to capture as a duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} to
non-virtual quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}
eliminates 23 quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}
out of 24, leaving only the forward quadrant of the major
plane[]{.indexref
entry="major plane:Duke vertical cross planes perpendicular to the players."}.
The up and down quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}
of the major plane are face quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}
and thus share a duplex tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
(KR3,3 & Q3,3) with the minor plane. Note the dimmed decorators.
Captures to these quadrants are forbidden.

Three things to note; this is a *capture in the* *dominant
plane*[]{.indexref
entry="dominant plane:An orthogonal plane which contains one or more promotion tiles."}
(where rook advance occurs), it is a capture move *two* tiles closer to
promotion, and now White's pawn, as a duke, has been able to
*diffuse*[]{.indexref
entry="diffuse:The openness of slant planes allows dukes to diffuse around other pieces on tiles of opposite duke colors in the same metallicity."}
around Black's pawn in *one* move. More violations of derivative
invariants.

A visual look at the figure suggests an arrow, so the name *dart
capture*[]{.indexref
entry="dart capture:Pawn capture to a duke apex tile diagonally ahead on the advance level."}
has been chosen to refer to captures to this tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}.
It also starts with the letter 'd' for duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."}, and since
capture to this tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
reduces[]{.indexref
entry="reduces:Linear moves with one virtual quadrant reduce to full quadrants."}
the promotion distance by *two* moves, the name also suggests quickness.
A dart capture advances the pawn closer to promotion faster than any
other capture and does so faster than all other horizontal advances with
the sole exception of the optional double advance to an apex tile, which
is a tie. The astute reader may also recognize it as the queen's
q-tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."},
where it is accessible as both rook and duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."}.

#### Doubly Reduced Linear Captures (Direct)

In the four cross planes, all four quadrants are virtual; the only tiles
that do not recede from promotion are the corner tiles, which are closer
to promotion by one move.

Figure 98 shows the four quadrants (out to perimeter 1) of one of the
cross planes (down left) for the KB3,3 pawn. Again, all four quadrants
are virtual, but the corner tile is closer to promotion by one move. The
other three cross planes[]{.indexref
entry="cross planes:Duke planes come in planes connecting opposing board faces."}
look just like this one; just rotations and mirror images of each other.

![[]{#_Ref185583182 .anchor}Figure 98: Pawn Duke Cross Planes -- All
Four Quadrants are Virtual, But the End Tile is
Not](media/image99.png){alt="A picture containing text, checker Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="3.936111111111111in"}

The perimeter 1 tiles (all four quadrants) of a representative cross
plane, in this case, the down left cross plane[]{.indexref
entry="left cross plane:A duke cross plane connecting the left-hand faces of the board."}.
All four quadrants contain at least one tile which recedes from
promotion, but one of the end tiles (Q4,4 in this example) is
nonetheless closer to promotion. The odd result is that moves to these
end tiles are allowed, but since there are no advancement squares (or
rectangles) associated with them, they are *direct* moves which cannot
be blocked. Note the dimmed decorators; all but the corner move.

This means that captures to these two tiles, nearest neighbors connected
by corners, are not actually planar moves, as the only tiles involved
are the source and destination tiles, they cannot be blocked. This
preserves an important invariant from 2D chess; a pawn attack along one
diagonal is independent of the other diagonal.

Figure 99 shows captures to these tiles. There are no advancement
squares (or rectangles) associated with these moves even though they are
straight-line moves. They are direct moves, not linear moves, and
captures to these tiles cannot be blocked.

![[]{#_Ref185583168 .anchor}Figure 99: Pawn Duke Doubly Reduced Linear
Captures -- Not Blockable
(Direct)](media/image100.png){alt="A screenshot of a video game Description automatically generated with low confidence"
width="6.5in" height="3.936111111111111in"}

Even though all four quadrants in the four cross planes[]{.indexref
entry="cross planes:Duke planes come in planes connecting opposing board faces."}
are virtual, the two corner tiles that also lie in the major plane
actually advance toward promotion. Thus, not only is capture allowed to
them, but such captures cannot be blocked as they have no associated
advancement manifolds -- they are *direct*[]{.indexref
entry="direct:Linear moves with two virtual quadrants reduce to a single end tile."}
moves; neither linear nor quadrant. When in the primary major plane,
they are also the captures that project to the 2D bishop capture.

These two tiles also lie in the major plane. When in the primary major
plane, they correspond to the pawn's bishop captures in 2D chess. The 3D
move is correctly projecting into 2D; one of our discovery criteria.

Technically, captures to these two direct tiles cannot be blocked in
either the left cross planes[]{.indexref
entry="cross planes:Duke planes come in planes connecting opposing board faces."}
or the right cross planes[]{.indexref
entry="cross planes:Duke planes come in planes connecting opposing board faces."}.
A capture to either of these two tiles will be referred to as a
*direct*[]{.indexref
entry="direct:Linear moves with two virtual quadrants reduce to a single end tile."}
*capture*[]{.indexref
entry="direct capture:Pawn capture as a duke linear move with two virtual quadrants."}.

### Captures

The pawn's move is typically described as "advance like a rook, capture
like a bishop." These instructions are disjoint in 2D because the rook
and bishop moves do not overlap, but in 3D the rook, bishop, and duke
moves do overlap. Because of overlap tiles, the barrier between
'advance' and 'capture' is porous[]{.indexref
entry="porous:An ineffective fence."}. Along the way, a half dozen 2D
derivative invariants were identified which are violated by 3D chess.
The dart and bead[]{.indexref
entry="bead:Pawn capture as a linear bishop move diagonally in front."}
captures are to tiles which the pawn can *also* advance to. That it is a
bit jarring, and raises the all-important question, "does it feel like
chess?"

Tiles are empty containers, but in the context of a particular piece,
they take on characteristics. The tile diagonally in front of the pawn
is a perimeter 1 *apex tile* for a rook advance, but a perimeter 1
*linear tile* for a bishop linear capture. The tile two diagonals in
front of the pawn is an apex tile on *perimeter 2* for a rook double
advance, but on *perimeter 1* for a duke capture. The advancement
manifolds are different, the perimeters are different. A piece which
blocks an advance might not block[]{.indexref
entry="block:Blocks cover, prevents a piece from moving to a desired location."}
a capture and vice-a-versa. The richness here is latent in 2D chess,
it's just that in two dimensions there isn't enough resolution to fully
reveal the pawn's true potential.

To enforce advance and capture to be as disjoint in 3D as in 2D requires
that one or the other move must be denied its full 3D nature. If the
rook is allowed its 2x2 and 3x3 advancement squares, then the bishop and
duke lose theirs. If the bishop and duke are allowed their full 3D
nature, then the rook's advance has holes in it, the two apex tiles, and
that has the side effect of increasing the distance to promotion.

When the pawn is allowed to retain its full 3D nature across all three
pieces, then the overlap tiles become unavoidable. While it is not yet
obvious at this stage of development, the net effect of embracing the
overlap tiles is to preserve the strategic role of the pawns, but there
will be some tactical adjustments. On balance, they do indeed *feel like
chess*.

But to be on the safe side, let's consider, just for a moment, the
consequences of constraining the 3D pawn to be more like the 2D pawn.
Since allowing the pawn to retain its full "planar move[]{.indexref
entry="planar move:A move without a trajectory in a plane which cuts a 3D board."}/advancement
square[]{.indexref
entry="advancement square:An NxN advancement manifold, must be empty for a legal move."}
nature" violates all six derivative invariants[]{.indexref
entry="derivative invariants:Pawn invariants with tactical but not strategic implications."}
of 2D chess, we'll use that list as our evaluation criteria.

Here is the list with the name of the offending tiles:

1)  No tiles accessible as *both* rook and bishop (bead[]{.indexref
    entry="bead:Pawn capture as a linear bishop move diagonally in front."},
    dart on double advance).

2)  Capture changes only *one* rank and *one* file (dart, sling,
    predator).

3)  Capture reduces[]{.indexref
    entry="reduces:Linear moves with one virtual quadrant reduce to full quadrants."}
    promotion distance by precisely *one* move (dart, sling, reduced).

4)  Two opposing pawns *always* block[]{.indexref
    entry="block:Blocks cover, prevents a piece from moving to a desired location."}
    each other's advance (bead[]{.indexref
    entry="bead:Pawn capture as a linear bishop move diagonally in front."}).

5)  It takes *two* captures for a pawn to diffuse[]{.indexref
    entry="diffuse:The openness of slant planes allows dukes to diffuse around other pieces on tiles of opposite duke colors in the same metallicity."}
    around a blocking piece (dart).

6)  A blocking opponent cannot be *captured* (bead[]{.indexref
    entry="bead:Pawn capture as a linear bishop move diagonally in front."}).

Interestingly, none of these are absolute. There are positions and
captures that do not violate them, but there are special cases which do.

Figure 100 shows the 14 proposed tiles the 3D pawn can capture to. In
2D, the pawn can cover[]{.indexref
entry="cover:Can move to a tile, generic term for attack foe or defend friend."}
2 tiles, but the 3D board is 8 times bigger, so to have the same power
projection on the 3D board would require the pawn to cover[]{.indexref
entry="cover:Can move to a tile, generic term for attack foe or defend friend."}
16 tiles; actually, not that far apart.

![[]{#_Ref185759592 .anchor}Figure 100: Pawn Attacks from Starting
Position](media/image101.png){alt="Shape Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="5.336111111111111in"}

All the tiles the pawn can attack from the starting position in 2D (a)
and 3D (b).

Let's see what happens if we try to prohibit capture to the tiles that
violate one or more of the derivative invariants[]{.indexref
entry="derivative invariants:Pawn invariants with tactical but not strategic implications."}.
Between them, they violate all six of the derivative
invariants[]{.indexref
entry="derivative invariants:Pawn invariants with tactical but not strategic implications."},
some of them multiple times. The only tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
not on this list is the direct[]{.indexref
entry="direct:Linear moves with two virtual quadrants reduce to a single end tile."}
tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."},
the two linear duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} captures
where both quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}
in two planes are virtual, so the move isn't even blockable. Prohibiting
capture to 5 of these 6 tile types leaves no evidence that advancement
squares were even involved, would be completely arbitrary, and would
leave the 3D pawn with a PPR[]{.indexref
entry="PPR:Power projection ratio, portion of the board reachable in 1 move."}
*one eighth* that of a 2D pawn; it won't feel like chess[]{.indexref
entry="feel like chess:Play in 3D must feel like chess, a one pawn advantage wins."}.

Picking and choosing between which derivative invariants to honor and
which to violate would be completely arbitrary, an act of invention
rather than of discovery. It's all or nothing, and the 'nothing' hobbles
the pawn to the point where it can no longer play the strategic and
tactical role it had in 2D. We choose the 'all.' They reveal a depth and
richness to chess that is almost fractal -- the tactics and strategies
of 3D chess will have no problems with them.

We have discovered that the pawn capture rules require the pawn to be a
fully functional 3D piece, with complete advancement squares and
advancement rectangles. The three fundamental invariants of the 2D pawn,
when correctly interpreted, can be fully kept.

1.  Keep the direction restriction; reduced or direct when quadrants are
    virtual.

2.  Keep a limited range[]{.indexref
    entry="range:What percentage of the board a piece can eventually reach."}
    of one step (perimeter[]{.indexref
    entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} 1),
    but also keep the double advance exception.

3.  Keep separate advance and capture; *advance* like a rook, *capture*
    like a higher base piece.

These are the fundamental invariants; the derivative invariants are red
herrings.

### The Pawn's Value

The restrictions on the pawn's move limit its power projection making it
the least valuable piece. It is assigned a material value of 1; indeed,
the pawn is the unit of measure for the material value of all the other
pieces. Every other piece is worth multiple pawns.

### Shackled Capture

Once the pawn reaches a back plane, it becomes unshackled; its range
limit is lifted and is now just one move away from promotion. However,
most of the capture tiles lie off the board; dart and direct[]{.indexref
entry="direct:Linear moves with two virtual quadrants reduce to a single end tile."}
(duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."}); predator,
sling, and bead[]{.indexref
entry="bead:Pawn capture as a linear bishop move diagonally in front."}
(bishop). Only bishop reduced tiles are still on the board.

This leaves a bit of an imbalance between the bishop and duke captures
and the intent of partial promotion. Recall that once off the primary
plane, a few of the pawn's potential capture tiles would advance toward
promotion. We chose to deny capture to those tiles since it resulted in
a position dependent rule. Position sensitive rules do not feel like
chess, pawn double advance and promotion being the exceptions. A 2D pawn
on rank 8 promotes and thus its legal moves change; it might now move as
a queen. It is a one-time, non-reversible change and as such does not
place a large computational load upon the player. Similar arguments
apply to the double advance.

Therefore, an unshackled pawn, in a one-time, non-reversible change, is
allowed its duke duplex attack once it reaches a back plane. The other
perimeter tiles of this duke attack are not on the back plane and thus
are farther away from promotion -- they lie on a virtual quadrant. This
reduces the duplex tiles to direct captures. The consequence is that
once a pawn is on a back plane it cannot get off it.

[]{#_Toc210218270 .anchor}Congruent Rule : **Pawn promotions are
irreversible.**

With these choices, a pawn in a back plane may still move as either
rook, bishop, or duke (all three base pieces), conditions permitting,
essentially the same as before is partial promotion.

Figure 101 shows an example of a pawn in the left back plane forking a
rook and knight via bishop reduced tiles, along with its duplex attack
(extended off the board so the alternating pattern is clear). Lifting
the range[]{.indexref
entry="range:What percentage of the board a piece can eventually reach."}
limit on capture as well as advance when a pawn reaches a back plane is
an effective and natural partial promotion[]{.indexref
entry="partial promotion:The idea that back planes should aid in pawn promotion."}.

![[]{#_Ref62120129 .anchor}Figure 101: Pawn Unshackled
Capture](media/image102.png){alt="Background pattern Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="6.111805555555556in"}

A pawn's range[]{.indexref
entry="range:What percentage of the board a piece can eventually reach."}
limit is removed once it reaches a back plane; it has become
*unshackled*. Most of the normal capture tiles are off the board.
However, one pair of the bishop reduced tile sequences remain on the
board. The White pawn (K8,5) is forking Black's rook and knight, in
which capture of either will result in immediate promotion. While the
reduced tiles remain on the board, all the other tiles in the
advancement squares do not, so these are effectively direct[]{.indexref
entry="direct:Linear moves with two virtual quadrants reduce to a single end tile."}
attacks. Also shown are the duke duplex attacks, which now that the pawn
is far off the major plane advance toward promotion. Since half of each
quadrant is off the board, and since the pawn cannot reach the other
tiles that are, these are also regarded as direct attacks, non
blockable. This is a one-time non-reversible upgrade to the pawn's move
-- a partial promotion.

### \-\--

### Uplift

In 2D, a pawn can never advance to an occupied tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."};
capture to one, yes, but advance to one, no. This applies in the special
case of promotion; if the promotion tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
is occupied, the pawn is blocked from promoting. This is mostly true in
3D chess as well, thoroughly if the occupying piece is from the
opposition. Unless the pawn can capture it, the pawn is blocked from
promoting.

However, as we have seen before, special cases are common in 3D chess
where traditional behavior is the norm, but the odd situation shows that
a continuum was in play that 2D chess could only access with crude
resolution. Indeed, the higher the dimension in which chess is played,
the more this occurs, the discrete nature of the board gradually
fractals out.

When the promotion tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
holds a friendly piece, promotion is blocked if the occupying piece is a
king, queen, rook, stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."}, or
even a knight. Notice what's missing?

Part of the obstinacy of the trajectory[]{.indexref
entry="trajectory:A unique path (a sequence of tiles) from one tile to another."}
paradigm is that the physical act of moving a piece deludes us into
thinking that a move consists of sequential parts; it doesn't. A move is
an *atomic* event; initial condition, final condition; as long as both
pre and post conditions are legal and the move valid, it is allowed.
Think about castling, same principle.

If the promotion tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
has a friendly piece on it that is a bishop or a duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."}, the pawn
may promote[]{.indexref
entry="promote:Reaching the home column, a pawn upgrades to a more powerful piece."}
to a stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."}.[^37]
Indeed, when the promotion tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
is so occupied, it is the pawn's only promotion option. It is not the
case that the pawn must *first* advance to the promotion
tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."},
*then* promote[]{.indexref
entry="promote:Reaching the home column, a pawn upgrades to a more powerful piece."}
to the compatible piece, *then* recombine to form a stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."}.
Nope, pawn here, stack[]{.indexref

there, done.

Our stories of what is happening behind the scenes are fictions, they
are make-believe. The transition from classical physics to quantum
physics was hampered by this illusion; the same illusion that made it so
hard to discover[]{.indexref
entry="discover:A piece which when moved unblocks an attack from another piece."}
planar moves and advancement squares in the first place.

If a queen is required to win the game, the occupying bishop or
duke[]{.indexref

to move first. Two moves; the pawn may not last that long, so know your

While the term, 'stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."}
recombination[]{.indexref
entry="recombination:A bishop or duke reconstituting a stack by moving onto the other."}
promotion' is technically more accurate, it is also awkward; the term
*uplift*[]{.indexref
entry="uplift:Pawn promotes an existing bishop or duke to a stack."}
will be used instead.

Figure 102 shows a couple of examples of uplift[]{.indexref

use pawn promotion to get a duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} on a gem
plane[]{.indexref

The 3D pawn offers an extraordinarily rich set of potential chess
puzzles[]{.indexref
entry="chess puzzles:Limited objective practice situations which stress chess principles"}.

events.**

Examples](media/image103.png){alt="Background pattern Description automatically generated with medium confidence"

Six examples of pawn promotion, showing three uplifts and how they
relate to more conventional promotions. (a) A pawn promotes to a queen
in the horizontal plane, (b) the pawn next level down is blocked from
promoting by the knight (dimmed decorators), (c) pawn uplifts a bishop
to a stack via horizontal plane[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."}, (d)
promotion to a queen in the horizontal plane (unshackled promotion is
blocked, (e) an unshackled uplift[]{.indexref
entry="uplift:Pawn promotes an existing bishop or duke to a stack."} of
a duke[]{.indexref

well as by the black bishop (QR8,8) but could promote[]{.indexref

advance (either level or left back plane linear), and (g) an unshackled
uplift[]{.indexref
entry="uplift:Pawn promotes an existing bishop or duke to a stack."} of
bishop (QR8,8). Ghost images are used for the single promoted pieces,
but for uplifts only the missing component piece is ghosted, the
occupying piece is full image.

### Promotion Variance

This is a good point at which to summarize the variance in the promotion
distance for various moves and locations. The derivative
invariants[]{.indexref
entry="derivative invariants:Pawn invariants with tactical but not strategic implications."}
of 2D chess are that single advance and capture reduce the promotion
distance by exactly *one* move. The situation in 3D chess is richer.

Advances to apex[]{.indexref
entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."}
tiles reduce the promotion distance by one move (two for the double
advance). Advances to end tiles reduce the promotion distance by half a
move[]{.indexref
entry="half a move:Pawn moves off the primary plane still reduce the promotion distance."}
(one move for the double advance). For double advances there are two
tiles on perimeter 2 of the 3x3 advancement square which are between the
apex and end tiles. Give them the label []{#between_tile
.anchor}*between* *tile*[]{.indexref
entry="between tile:The pair of tiles between apex and end tiles for a pawn double advance."}.
Advances to between tiles reduce the promotion distance by one and a
half moves.

Captures to duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."}
*direct*[]{.indexref
entry="direct:Linear moves with two virtual quadrants reduce to a single end tile."}
tiles decrease promotion distance by one full move. Captures to bishop
*reduced* tiles, decrease promotion distance by half a move[]{.indexref
entry="half a move:Pawn moves off the primary plane still reduce the promotion distance."}.
Captures to *sling* tiles, decrease promotion distance by one and a half
moves; this makes them very valuable moves, and an important element in
pawn wall[]{.indexref
entry="pawn wall:Cooperating interconnected set of pawns which hamper development."}
construction.

Captures to bishop *bead*[]{.indexref
entry="bead:Pawn capture as a linear bishop move diagonally in front."}
tiles decrease promotion distance by one full move. Captures to bishop
*predator* tiles also decrease promotion distance by one full move. But
captures to duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} *dart*
tiles decrease promotion distance by two moves.

Every half integer step towards promotion up to two is available. This
is twice the resolution that 2D pawns have.

A pawn that makes neither apex[]{.indexref
entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."}
advances nor double advances, and that also makes no dart,
direct[]{.indexref
entry="direct:Linear moves with two virtual quadrants reduce to a single end tile."},
bead[]{.indexref
entry="bead:Pawn capture as a linear bishop move diagonally in front."},
predator or sling captures, will only advance toward promotion at half a
move[]{.indexref
entry="half a move:Pawn moves off the primary plane still reduce the promotion distance."}
per move until it reaches a back plane. Worse case, the pawn requires 12
moves to promote. This is just another way of characterizing promotion
molasses.

The next two figures show all the cases.

Figure 103 shows the rook advances (White), and the duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} captures
(Black).

Figure 104 shows the bishop captures; to sling and predator tiles
(White), and to bead[]{.indexref
entry="bead:Pawn capture as a linear bishop move diagonally in front."}
and reduced tiles (Black).

Promotion variance is mainly a concern for pawns which never reach a
back plane. For those that do, any difference between left and right
moves adds only one more move to promotion, as long as the pawn heads
toward the nearest back plane from then on.

![[]{#_Ref62126297 .anchor}Figure 103: Pawn Promotion Variance for Rook
Advance & Duke
Capture](media/image104.png){alt="A picture containing shape Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="6.111805555555556in"}

Examples of pawn promotion variance for rook like advances (White) and
duke like captures (Black). Double advances to apex tiles shorten by 2,
to either between tile by 1Â½, and to either end tile by 1. Single
advances to apex tiles shorten by 1, to either end tile by Â½. Dart
captures shorten by 2, and direct captures shorten by 1. White pawns
show the advances as a rook, Black pawns show the captures as a
duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."}. Ghost
pawns show the relevant moves.

![[]{#_Ref62127748 .anchor}Figure 104: Pawn Promotion Variance for
Bishop
Capture](media/image105.png){alt="A picture containing shape Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="6.111805555555556in"}

Examples of pawn promotion variance for bishop like captures. White
makes apex captures (sling and predator); Black makes captures to
adjacent tiles (bead and reduced). Sling captures shorten by 1Â½,
predator captures by 1. Bead captures shorten by 1, reduced captures
shorten by Â½. Ghost pawns show the relevant moves.

In 2D, capture as a bishop could reduce the distance to promotion by
only 1 move. In 3D, bishop capture is smoothed out adding 1 half of a
move[]{.indexref
entry="half a move:Pawn moves off the primary plane still reduce the promotion distance."}
and 3 halves of a move. Duke capture extends this list to include 2
moves. More of the same, just with higher resolution.

### 2D Projection of the 3D Move

We'll consider two planes in which to project the pawn's 3D advance and
capture moves; a slant plane[]{.indexref
entry="slant plane:Plane a duke moves in, separates opposite edges of the board."},
in particular the primary major plane[]{.indexref
entry="major plane:Duke vertical cross planes perpendicular to the players."},
and a vertical orthogonal plane[]{.indexref
entry="orthogonal plane:The space a 3D rookâs planar moves occur in."}.

The primary plane[]{.indexref
entry="primary plane:Largest major plane, contains starting lineup & promotion tiles."}
can be mapped one-to-one with the 2D board. In that plane, a pawn
advance to the apex[]{.indexref
entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."}
tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
on perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} 1 is
just the 2D single advance move, and the advance to the apex[]{.indexref
entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."}
tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
on perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} 2 is
just the 2D double advance move. If the pawn advances to an end
tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."},
then in the vertical orthogonal planes, that looks like a pawn's advance
in 2D. Only the double advance to a perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} 2
tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
that is neither an apex[]{.indexref
entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."}
tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
nor one of the end tiles, fails to have a decent projection into two
dimensions. That move, quite literally, falls between the cracks; 2D
chess doesn't have enough resolution to exhibit that behavior.

For capture, the duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."}
direct[]{.indexref
entry="direct:Linear moves with two virtual quadrants reduce to a single end tile."}
capture[]{.indexref
entry="direct capture:Pawn capture as a duke linear move with two virtual quadrants."}
is in the major plane[]{.indexref
entry="major plane:Duke vertical cross planes perpendicular to the players."},
and it is quite exactly the 2D bishop capture move. Recall that the
duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} inherits
some of the 2D bishop nature since both change all coordinates. The
bishop reduced capture[]{.indexref
entry="reduced capture:Pawn capture to a bishop edge tile one level away."}
tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
is, in the vertical orthogonal planes, the bishop capture of 2D. The
sling capture[]{.indexref
entry="sling capture:Pawn capture to a bishop apex tile one level away."}
does not map naturally; it too falls between the cracks, and for the
same reason; it lies off the metal plane and is instead in the gem
plane[]{.indexref
entry="gem plane:Gem planes are vertical slant planes with only ruby & jade tiles."}.
However, the dart, bead[]{.indexref
entry="bead:Pawn capture as a linear bishop move diagonally in front."}
and predator tiles do not map at all; their existence is initially
jarring.

In the draft rule set patented in 1991 we chickened out and denied these
moves. Since then, I have come to trust the planar move and advancement
square idioms.[^38] Still, a game has to be both playable and
interesting. There is room here for balance rules that restrict some of
these options. Countless hours of play will be required before we can be
certain. I chose to err on the side of being permissive, since a
computer version will let players agreed to play below the rules but
will prevent playing above them.

### Metal Planes and Gem Planes

Recall that all the pieces start in a metal plane, and that the dukes
cannot reach any gem planes. However, the pawns can; indeed, it happens
on any first move which approaches promotion by a half-integral move.
This has the advantage of making the pawn safe from duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} capture.

Pawns can capture in both kinds of planes, metal or gem, regardless of
which type of plane the pawn is in. The dart, direct[]{.indexref
entry="direct:Linear moves with two virtual quadrants reduce to a single end tile."},
bead[]{.indexref
entry="bead:Pawn capture as a linear bishop move diagonally in front."}
and predator tiles are all captures in the *current* plane[]{.indexref
entry="slant plane:Plane a duke moves in, separates opposite edges of the board."};
that's six attacks in the current plane. The sling and reduced tiles are
all captures in *adjacent* planes, of necessity to a different pair of
duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} colors than
the current plane; that's eight attacks in the other planes. Recall that
only vertical slant planes have pure metallicities. The left cross pair
and the right cross pair slant planes contain tiles of one metallic
color and one gem color.

This is complex enough to justify its own figure.

Figure 105 shows three pairs of opposing pawns. Each pawn is still in
its starting position, so White and Black pawns are on opposite metal
colors (gold/silver). There is one pair of pawns on the king side where
their possible *captures* are shown, and two pairs of pawns on the queen
side where their possible *advances* are shown. What's different in this
figure is the emphasis on duke colors.

![[]{#_Ref62143248 .anchor}Figure 105: Pawn Duke Colors for Advance and
Capture](media/image106.png){alt="Diagram Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="6.111805555555556in"}

The duke colors for pawn captures (king side, raised tiles) and advances
(queen side, new colored decorators). Dart and direct[]{.indexref
entry="direct:Linear moves with two virtual quadrants reduce to a single end tile."}
tiles have the same color as the source tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."},
bead[]{.indexref
entry="bead:Pawn capture as a linear bishop move diagonally in front."}
and predator tiles the opposite color. Sling and reduced tiles have
opposite metallicities, gem planes in this example (ruby[]{.indexref
entry="ruby:One of two duke colored gem tiles, there are no ruby dukes."}/jade[]{.indexref
entry="jade:One of two duke colored gem tiles, there are no jade dukes."}),
with opposite gem colors to either side. Any bishop 2x2 advancement
square contains one tile of each duke color.

For capture, the tiles under attack are raised to reveal their duke
colors. This allows the correlation between duke color and type of
attack (bishop or duke) to be clearly seen. Since dukes can't change
duke colors, this is mostly useful for understanding bishop attacks.
Obviously, dart and direct attacks have the same color as the source
tile and thus the metallicity is unchanged. In contrast, both predator
tiles (two levels away) and bead tiles (diagonally in front) have the
opposite duke color. Thus, dart, direct, predator and bead attacks do
not change metallicity.

The reduced and sling tiles do change metallicity, but mirror each
other, doubly. The outward planes have opposite duke colors and also the
reduced and sling tiles have opposite colors. An interesting consequence
of these patterns is that when a pawn captures like a duke it *doesn't*
change duke colors, but when it captures like a bishop it *does* change
duke colors. Notice how every 2x2 bishop advancement square[]{.indexref
entry="advancement square:An NxN advancement manifold, must be empty for a legal move."}
contains one tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
of each duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} color.

When a pawn captures like a bishop, it doesn't change bishop colors, but
when it captures like a duke, it may; it changes bishop colors for an
attack on direct tiles but doesn't change bishop colors for a dart
attack. This makes sense because a dart tile is a q-tile.

While the duke colors of pawn capture tiles can be sensibly revealed by
raising tiles, this does not work well for revealing the duke colors of
pawn advance, the regular arrangement of tiles on the same level hides
too many tile edges. Instead, new decorators are introduced, which
supplant the usual red decorators for the rook-like advance of the pawn.

For advance, apex tiles alternate duke colors in the current
metallicity, end tiles alternate metallicities, and the between tiles
switch to the opposite metallicity. For a single advance, the pawn will
change duke colors. For a double advance, the apex and end tiles will
have the same duke color as the source tile, but the between tiles will
be in the opposite metallicity and have opposing duke colors, but
identical bishop colors.

It's all very mathematical, even aesthetic. For a gamer, the main
significance is how it eases knowing who can attack whom without having
to mentally map out every advancement square[]{.indexref
entry="advancement square:An NxN advancement manifold, must be empty for a legal move."}.

### Opposing Pawns

In 2D, a pair of opposing pawns in the same *file*, will reach a
standoff situation where neither can advance. In 3D, the situation is
richer. A pair of opposing pawns on the same *level*, may reach a
standoff situation or not; it depends on their relative positions.

In both cases, the resolution of a standoff requires that either one
pawn *be* captured, or one pawn *performs* a capture.

In 2D, a pair of opposing pawns (one White one Black in the same
*file*), will reach a standoff situation where neither can advance. The
resolution of a standoff requires either that one pawn be captured, or
that one or the other pawn makes a capture.

In 3D, the situation is richer. A pair of opposing pawns (one White one
Black on the same *level*) may reach a standoff situation, but also may
not; depends on their relative positions and may in fact depend on other
pieces not even on the same level.

Figure 106 shows the possible standoff situations. In (a) is the classic
standoff situation in 2D; there is only one. In this example, it is the
king pawns which block[]{.indexref
entry="block:Blocks cover, prevents a piece from moving to a desired location."}
each other's advance; both may still capture if the opportunity presents
itself. In 3D, a pair of pawns may get into a []{#static_standoff
.anchor}*static standoff*[]{.indexref
entry="static standoff:Pair of opposing pawns are blocked all on their own."}*,*
two examples of which are shown in (b), on the KR and KN levels. These
pawns are in adjacent cubes connected by a face.

It is also possible, however, that opposing pawns can []{#sidestep
.anchor}*sidestep*[]{.indexref
entry="sidestep:Opposing pawns avoiding standoff by sidestepping around each other."}
each other. They must be at least two slant planes apart. This is shown
in (c); note that the two red 2x2 advancement squares do not overlap.

On the king level, another example of static standoff[]{.indexref
entry="static standoff:Pair of opposing pawns are blocked all on their own."}
is shown (d), but this time the pair of pawns are very near their
respective back planes. While each is far from promotion via horizontal
advance, should either be captured, the White pawn is only three
advances from promotion and the Black pawn only two via back plane
advance. If one pawn resolves the standoff by itself making a capture,
it could be only one move away from promotion if the capture lands it on
the back plane. For White, a dart capture or an outside sling capture
would accomplish this. For Black, either a bead, direct capture, or an
outside reduced capture would land it on the back plane.

By themselves, a pair of opposing pawns each on the other's bead tile
would not be a standoff; either could simply capture the other. However,
capture to a bead tile is a bishop linear move, and could thus be
blocked. This requires two other pieces, each positioned so that both
planes are blocked. This results in a []{#dynamic_standoff
.anchor}*dynamic standoff*[]{.indexref
entry="dynamic standoff:Pair of opposing pawns are temporarily blocked by pinned pieces."}*,*
as shown in (e) with two knights. Both the White and Black linear moves
are shown with a pair of 2x3 advancement rectangles, which overlap on
the direct tiles. While the knights block[]{.indexref
entry="block:Blocks cover, prevents a piece from moving to a desired location."}
the bead attacks in the outward planes, each might be capturable in the
forward planes. In this example that possibility is exclude because the
White pawn's capture is blocked by the bishop on the apex tile two
levels up and the Black pawns' capture is blocked by the pawn on the
apex tiles two levels down. Note the symmetries.

The knights are pinned[]{.indexref
entry="pinned:A piece which if moved unblocks an attack on a higher value piece."}
against the opposing pawns. If either knight moves, either pawn may now
capture the other. In 2D, it is not possible for a piece to be
pinned[]{.indexref
entry="pinned:A piece which if moved unblocks an attack on a higher value piece."}
against a pawn capture.

![[]{#_Ref62258224 .anchor}Figure 106: Pawn Standoff
Situations](media/image107.png){alt="A picture containing diagram Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="7.428472222222222in"}

Opposing pawns are in a standoff in 2D when on adjacent squares
connected by sides; king pawns in (a). In 3D, opposing pawns are in a
*static* standoff[]{.indexref
entry="static standoff:Pair of opposing pawns are blocked all on their own."}
(b) & (d) when on adjacent cubes connected by faces (KR, KN, K) or in a
*dynamic* standoff[]{.indexref
entry="dynamic standoff:Pair of opposing pawns are temporarily blocked by pinned pieces."}
(e) when on each other's bead[]{.indexref
entry="bead:Pawn capture as a linear bishop move diagonally in front."}
tiles when capture is blocked by *two* other pieces (knights), one in
each plane. The king pawns have passed each other and have
*side-stepped* a standoff all together (c); note the pair of red 2x2
advancement squares.

### Shape

The shape is squatter than in 2D, partly so that when the board
perspective is in the diagonal neutral position favored here, it doesn't
get obscured too badly by larger pieces in front; it is wider than the
other pieces. The other motif is that of a sphere on a torus; which
constrains the sphere rolling any which way, alluding to the restricted
direction of the pawn, and neither does the sphere roll easily, alluding
to the limited range[]{.indexref
entry="range:What percentage of the board a piece can eventually reach."}
of the pawn. The sphere, of course, is the ultimate example of three
spatial dimensions.

### Power Projection

The pawn has two power projection ratios, one for advance and one for
capture. No attempt has been made to compute what the PPR[]{.indexref
entry="PPR:Power projection ratio, portion of the board reachable in 1 move."}
of a pawn straight line[]{.indexref
entry="straight line:Orthogonal (rook), diagonal (bishop)."} rule would
be; too many variations. However, the maximum power projection of an
unshackled pawn has been computed; this implies it was on rank 2.

### Review

The pawn *advances* like a rook but *captures* like a bishop or a
duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."}. The pawn
cannot capture as a rook; advance is a *strict* move[]{.indexref
entry="strict move:One that cannot capture, pawn advance, stack combine, teleportation."}.
Both advance and capture are restricted in *direction* and
*range*[]{.indexref
entry="range:What percentage of the board a piece can eventually reach."}.

The pawn must *promote*[]{.indexref
entry="promote:Reaching the home column, a pawn upgrades to a more powerful piece."}
when it reaches the home line[]{.indexref
entry="home line:Orthogonal line of the opponentâs starting line-up of the major pieces."}
of the opponents, called the *promotion line*[]{.indexref
entry="promotion line:The home row/column of the opponentâs major pieces."}.
It may promote[]{.indexref
entry="promote:Reaching the home column, a pawn upgrades to a more powerful piece."}
to any major piece except the king. If the promotion tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
contains a bishop or duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."}, it may
promote[]{.indexref
entry="promote:Reaching the home column, a pawn upgrades to a more powerful piece."},
but only to a stack[]{.indexref
entry="stack:The composite piece composed of a bishop and a duke."}, a
special case promotion called *uplift*[]{.indexref
entry="uplift:Pawn promotes an existing bishop or duke to a stack."}.

Direction is in reference to the promotion line[]{.indexref
entry="promotion line:The home row/column of the opponentâs major pieces."};
both advance and capture must be *toward* promotion. A *dominant*
plane[]{.indexref
entry="dominant plane:An orthogonal plane which contains one or more promotion tiles."}
is one that contains one or more promotion tiles. Advance may occur only
in dominant planes; every horizontal plane[]{.indexref
entry="horizontal plane:Rook plane that is horizontal (a level, constant Z-axis)."}
is dominant, but the only dominant vertical planes are the two *back
planes*[]{.indexref
entry="back planes:The pair of vertical planes which intersect at the pawn promotion line."}
which are maximally dominant.

Quadrants with any tiles which are farther from promotion are *virtual*.
Neither advance nor capture is allowed in virtual quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."},
and none of their tiles contribute to blocking. Linear moves with one
virtual quadrant[]{.indexref
entry="virtual quadrant:Any pawn quadrant with tiles further from promotion."}
*reduce* to quadrant moves[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant moves:A move into a quadrant, blocking is by an advancement square."};
if both quadrants[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant:The areas of planes bordered by straight-line moves."}
are virtual, but the end tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
does not recede from promotion, a *direct*[]{.indexref
entry="direct:Linear moves with two virtual quadrants reduce to a single end tile."}
move to the end tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
is permitted. Recall that for the purposes of determining if a quadrant
is virtual, direction is to be determined as if the pawn were in the
primary plane[]{.indexref
entry="primary plane:Largest major plane, contains starting lineup & promotion tiles."}.
This makes the rule position independent.

A *single advance* is to perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} 1, but
the first move may make a *double advance* to perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} 2.
Capture cannot occur past perimeter[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter:The outside edges of an advancement manifold."} 1. The
pawn captures to 14 tiles which come in 6 named types: *dart*,
*direct*[]{.indexref
entry="direct:Linear moves with two virtual quadrants reduce to a single end tile."},
*reduced*, *sling*, *predator*, and *bead*[]{.indexref
entry="bead:Pawn capture as a linear bishop move diagonally in front."}.;
the first two via duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."}, the last
four via bishop. While all make progress toward promotion, progress can
be half integral; half move, full move, one and half moves, or two
moves. Five of the six capture tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
types violate one or more of the six 2D derivative
invariants[]{.indexref
entry="derivative invariants:Pawn invariants with tactical but not strategic implications."}.

Pawns which advance to the back planes[]{.indexref
entry="back planes:The pair of vertical planes which intersect at the pawn promotion line."}
become *unshackled* and lose their range[]{.indexref
entry="range:What percentage of the board a piece can eventually reach."}
limit but not their direction restriction. This compensates for
*promotion molasses*[]{.indexref
entry="promotion molasses:Without apex moves, pawns can require 12 moves to promote."}.

While the pawns start in a metal plane, they can easily move to gem
planes where they are safe from duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} attack.
Pawns, like queens, can make duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} attacks in
the gem planes. A pawn changes duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} colors when
it makes a single advance. A pawn may change either bishop or
duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} colors when
it captures, or not. If it makes a bishop capture, it will change duke
colors.

The projection of the 3D pawn's move onto a 2D surface is mixed; it is
there, but not quite as clean as it was for the previous pieces.

Opposing pawns can avoid standoff via *sidestepping*, achieve a *static*
standoff[]{.indexref
entry="static standoff:Pair of opposing pawns are blocked all on their own."},
or a *dynamic* standoff[]{.indexref
entry="dynamic standoff:Pair of opposing pawns are temporarily blocked by pinned pieces."}.

The pawn's power projection is less but comparable to 2D; 40%-50% for
advance, 87% for capture. Unshackling only occurs when the pawn reaches
a *back plane*. Its unshackled advance PPR goes up (by a lot), but its
unshackled capture PPR goes down (by a little).

The effects of shackling are to cut the promotion distance, increase
advance and capture cover, and enable duplex captures.

## King

The king, like the pawn, has limited range[]{.indexref
entry="range:What percentage of the board a piece can eventually reach."},
but unlike the pawn, has no restriction on direction. The 2D king's move
is traditionally described as "moving to the *nearest neighbor*," but
could also be described as "moves like a *limited range*[]{.indexref
entry="range:What percentage of the board a piece can eventually reach."}
*queen*." These can be regarded as degenerate rules[]{.indexref
entry="degenerate rules:Equivalent in a lower abstraction but different in a higher abstraction."},
pick whichever yields 3D play that feels like chess, but in the case of
the king neither rule works. The former allows the king to move from the
starting position before any other pieces (no advancement manifolds),
there go the openings; call this the []{#adjacent_rule .anchor}*adjacent
rule*. The later allows the king to break through both rook and dual
bishop fences as well as win all close races against pawns or knights,
there go the endgames; call this the []{#natural_rule .anchor}*natural
rule*. The former denies the king his 3D nature, the latter allows the
full expression of it.

Rather than regarding the pair of degenerate rules[]{.indexref
entry="degenerate rules:Equivalent in a lower abstraction but different in a higher abstraction."}
as competing, they should be regarded as cooperating; not either, but
*both*; "the king moves to an adjacent tile *like* a limited range
queen" (perimeter 1). This can be achieved most simply by limiting the
king to linear moves only; no quadrant moves. This means the king cannot
advance to a bishop apex tile, nor to a duke apex or duplex tile. It
also means the king may not advance to a rook apex tile *as a rook,*
even though he may be able to advance to the very same tile as a bishop
(they are brook tiles). However, with judicially placed pieces, the
king's linear advance can be blocked, even by pieces on the apex tiles,
which the king cannot reach. Call this the []{#linear_rule
.anchor}*linear rule*[]{.indexref
entry="linear rule:King moves like a limited queen, linear moves to perimeter 1 only."}.

The king keeps his 3D nature, albeit in a restricted form, but the game
keeps its openings and endgames. To make sure this is a rule of
discovery and not a rule of invention, several metrics of these rules
will be presented.

### Decorators {#decorators-1}

Like the queen, the king's decorators will be bordered in purple. For
the adjacent rule, there is just one decorator: purple. For the natural
rule, the queen decorators will be used.

For the linear rule[]{.indexref
entry="linear rule:King moves like a limited queen, linear moves to perimeter 1 only."},
two new classes of decorators are added. Decorators which indicate a
linear move will have small diamonds offset in them. If open in both
planes, there will be two small solid black diamonds, if open in only
one, there will be one solid and one outlined, and if all planes are
blocked, all will be in outline. The duke decorator simply makes room
for three small diamonds.

For the apex tiles that cannot be reached, there will be an open
(transparent) middle diamond around a small solid diamond of the color
of the base piece. The openness indicates that the king cannot move
there, but another piece there will block that perimeter. You might find
the idea of the openness as an indicator of 'unstable ground' to be a
useful mnemonic.

The openness serves a secondary purpose. Just because the king can't
move to a rook apex tile as a rook doesn't necessarily mean he cannot
move there at all; that's a brook tile and he may be able to move there
as a bishop. When all the decorators are in play, the green of the
bishop decorators shows through the open parts of the rook apex
decorator, making the combined decorator look a lot like the queen's
brook tile. This is intentional.

Figure 107 shows the adjacent and natural rules.

![[]{#_Ref74819888 .anchor}Figure 107: King Implies Two Inadequate Move
Rules -
Rejected](media/image108.png){alt="A picture containing text, pencil Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="3.936111111111111in"}

Giving the king direct access to adjacent tiles without advancement
manifolds allows him to move prior to any other piece; breaks openings
(b). Treating the king as a limited range queen permits him to advance
to perimeter 1 of 2x2 advancement squares; the bishop and duke apex
tiles extend beyond the 26 adjacent tiles (42 apex tiles) allowing him
to penetrate rook and dual bishop fences and win all close pawn and
knight races; there go the endgames (a). Two potential rules, both bad.

The next figures show examples of the king's linear moves. All advances
are to perimeter 1 of 2x3 advancement rectangles each of which consists
of 5 tiles: one linear tile, two off limit apex tiles, and two end
tiles. A linear move generally occurs in 2 (or 3) planes unless one is
blocked.

### Rook-like Linear Advances

Figure 108 shows two kings contemplating linear rook moves. Decorators
are shown for the Black king looking at a linear move in the horizontal
plane and left vertical plane to KB2,3, and for the White king looking
at a linear move in both vertical planes to KN2,2. The ghost kings have
been suppressed in this figure to not obscure the linear decorator.

![[]{#_Ref74758684 .anchor}Figure 108: King Rook-like Linear
Moves](media/image109.png){alt="A picture containing checker Description automatically generated"
width="6.44in" height="5.34in"}

The Black king contemplates making a linear rook-like move out to his
KB2,3 tile; note the red double diamond decorator (a). This is a linear
move in the horizontal plane and Black's left vertical plane. The White
king contemplates making a linear rook-like move up a level to his KN2,2
tile; note the red double diamond decorator (b). This is a linear move
in both vertical planes. In each case there are two 2x3 advancement
rectangles, one for each plane; these would be moves to perimeter 1.
Note the open decorators on the rook apex tiles; the king cannot advance
to these tiles as a rook, but another piece would block advance on the
corresponding perimeter. Note that it takes two pieces to block a king's
linear rook advance unless one of them is on the linear tile itself.

### Bishop-like Linear Advances

Figure 109 shows two kings contemplating linear bishop moves. Decorators
are shown for the Black king looking at a linear move to KB3,3 in both
outward planes (a) (easy to visualize), and for the White king looking
at a linear move to KN2,3 in the upward and rightward planes (b). The
ghost kings have been suppressed in this figure to not obscure the
linear decorator.

![[]{#_Ref74758644 .anchor}Figure 109: King Bishop-like Linear
Moves](media/image110.png){alt="A picture containing checker, chessman Description automatically generated"
width="6.44in" height="5.34in"}

The Black king contemplates making a linear bishop-like move out to his
KB3,3 tile; note the green double diamond decorator (a). This is a
linear move in the outward planes. The White king contemplates making a
linear bishop-like move up a level to his KN2,3 tile; note the green
double diamond decorator (b). This is a linear move in the upward and
rightward planes. In each case there are two 2x3 advancement rectangles,
one for each plane; these would be moves to perimeter 1. All the bishop
apex tiles are outside the 26 adjacent tiles next to the kings. Note the
open decorators on the bishop apex tiles; the king cannot advance to
these tiles, but another piece would block advance on the corresponding
perimeter. As for the rook it takes two pieces to block a king's linear
bishop advance unless one of them is on the linear tile itself.

### Duke-like Linear Advances

Figure 110 shows two kings contemplating linear duke moves. The Black
king makes a linear move to KN3,3 in three planes; major, upleft and
upright (a), the White king makes a linear move to KN1,3 in three
planes; minor, downleft and downright (b). The ghost kings have been
suppressed in this figure to not obscure the linear decorator. The
existence of the three planes makes the duke move harder to visualize,
it may help to note that 6 of the 8 vertex (corner) tiles are involved.

![[]{#_Ref74819136 .anchor}Figure 110: King Duke-like Linear
Moves](media/image111.png){alt="A picture containing checker Description automatically generated"
width="6.44in" height="5.34in"}

The Black king contemplates making a linear duke-like move up a level to
his KN3,3 tile (primary plane); note the blue triple diamond decorator
(a). This is a linear move in the three planes: major, upleft, &
upright. The White king contemplates making a linear duke-like move up a
level to his KN1,3 tile (face of the board); note the blue triple
diamond decorator (b). This is a linear move in three planes: minor,
upleft, & upright. In each case there are three 2x3 advancement
rectangles, one for each plane; these would be moves to perimeter 1. All
the duke apex (and duplex) tiles are outside the 26 adjacent tiles next
to the kings. Note the open decorators on the duke apex/duplex tiles
(three are off the board); the king cannot advance to these tiles, but
another piece would block advance on the corresponding perimeter. Unlike
the rook and bishop, it takes three pieces to block a king's linear duke
advance unless one of them is on the linear tile itself.

The trickiest part of the king's move is that he can be blocked by tiles
he cannot immediately reach; the bishop apex and duke apex/duplex tiles,
and by tiles he can sometimes but not always reach; the rook apex tiles.
This takes a little getting used to, but all the other potential rules
for the king, (and we have looked at nearly a dozen), do not yield play
that feels like chess. As the development proceeds, the correctness of
this specification will become more and more apparent. So far, adherence
to the discovery principle has yielded the hoped-for fruits.

  ------------------------------------------------------------
  I suppose, sigh, that a balance rule could be added which
  allowed the king to advance like a rook to perimeter 1 brook
  tiles; they are within the 26 adjacent tiles. It is
  consistent with the 2D rules but treats the rook-like
  advance inconsistently with the other base pieces. This is
  outside the scope of our discovery discipline, but not
  outside the scope of a reasonable rule, and at the end of
  the day, playability should be allowed to trump principle.
  This too is chess like; both pawn double advance and
  castling violate principle but promote playability. For now,
  until deeper experience suggests differently, brook tiles
  are off limits via the king's rook-like advance.
  ------------------------------------------------------------

  ------------------------------------------------------------

### Congruent Rules

We are now ready to tackle specifying the king's linear rule[]{.indexref
entry="linear rule:King moves like a limited queen, linear moves to perimeter 1 only."}
as a dimension agnostic[]{.indexref
entry="dimension agnostic:Rules of chess which scale to higher dimensions as invariants."}
rule.

To do that succinctly we have to introduce the *advancement*
[]{#manifold_ladder .anchor}*manifold ladder*. There is only one rung on
this ladder in 2D, the straight-line move (with its advancement
trajectory, which grows one tile at-a-time). In 3D, there are two rungs;
the quadrant move (with its advancement square, which grows perimeter by
perimeter, each 2 tiles larger than the previous), and the linear move
(with its advancement rectangle, which grows perimeter by perimeter,
each 4 tiles larger than the previous). In 4D, there are presumably
three rungs...but I digress.

The king is restricted to advance via the highest rung on the
advancement manifold ladder, and to advance only to perimeter 1 of that
manifold. Since this phrasing is dimension agnostic[]{.indexref
entry="dimension agnostic:Rules of chess which scale to higher dimensions as invariants."},
consistent with the conventional 2D rule phrasing, and yields the 3D
linear rule[]{.indexref
entry="linear rule:King moves like a limited queen, linear moves to perimeter 1 only."},
it is the correct chess rule for the king.

[]{#_Toc210218272 .anchor}Congruent Rule : **The king advances to
adjacent tiles on perimeter 1 via the highest advancement rung.**

When pressured a king generally has two options; sit tight or move to an
adjacent tile. If no other piece can move, the sit tight option is
removed. Eliminating all other pieces, or fully blocking all which
remain, is a tactic which takes away the king's option to sit tight.

However, taking all the options away, when the king is not actually in
check, results in stalemate.

[]{#_Toc210218273 .anchor}Congruent Rule : **The game is over when there
is no legal move.**

[]{#_Toc210218274 .anchor}Congruent Rule : **If neither king is in check
when the game is over the result is stalemate.**

### Hemming

A key strategy in chess is to restrict your opponent's options. There
are two techniques for restricting the opposing king's options: hemming
and fencing. In fencing, the king's options are restricted because
adjacent tiles are being threatened; the king cannot move into check
(next section). In hemming, the king's options are restricted by pieces
which block his moves. To []{#hem .anchor}*hem*[]{.indexref
entry="hem:Restricting a kingâs options by blocking potential moves."} a
king requires pieces located on perimeter tiles which block his advance
to adjacent tiles.

In 2D, a king can be fully hemmed in only by occupying *all* the
adjacent tiles. In 3D, it is enough to block[]{.indexref
entry="block:Blocks cover, prevents a piece from moving to a desired location."}
each advancement rectangle. The number of pieces required to do this
will be a measure of the king's []{#degrees_of_freedom
.anchor}*degrees*[]{.indexref
entry="degrees:The degree of a trapdoor is the number of extra moves to retreat."}
*of freedom*[]{.indexref
entry="degrees of freedom:How many pieces it takes to block a kingâs move."}.

The difficulty of hemming a king is highly dependent on where the king
is on the board. In 2D, there are three situations: king in *corner*,
king on *side*, and king in the *open*. For 3D, there are four; king in
the *corner* (vertex), king along an *edge*, king on a *face*, and king
in the *open*.

The increase from 8 nearest neighbors to 26 would seem at first glance
to make hemming the king essentially impossible, but once restricted to
linear moves, which come with advancement rectangles, it turns out to be
easier than feared, and only a little more difficult than in 2D.

We'll compare the degrees[]{.indexref
entry="degrees:The degree of a trapdoor is the number of extra moves to retreat."}
of freedom[]{.indexref
entry="degrees of freedom:How many pieces it takes to block a kingâs move."}
in 2D against each of the potential rules for the 3D king; the adjacent
rule (direct move to adjacent tiles), the natural rule (perimeter 1
advancement squares and rectangles), and the linear rule[]{.indexref
entry="linear rule:King moves like a limited queen, linear moves to perimeter 1 only."}
(advancement rectangles only). The following table shows the minimum
number of pieces required to block[]{.indexref
entry="block:Blocks cover, prevents a piece from moving to a desired location."}
the king from moving.

: []{#_Toc210218559 .anchor}Table 11: **King Degrees of Freedom**

The only way to completely hem[]{.indexref
entry="hem:Restricting a kingâs options by blocking potential moves."}
the king in 3D under the adjacent rule is to place a piece on every
adjacent tile, same as 2D. (For 4D, there won't even be enough pieces on
the board.) For the natural rule, both quadrant and linear moves must be
blocked; it's a little tricky, so the reader will be spared the details,
and while a lot better than the adjacent rule, it still requires nearly
twice as many pieces as in 2D. The linear rule[]{.indexref
entry="linear rule:King moves like a limited queen, linear moves to perimeter 1 only."}
is the most effective in keeping the difficulty of hemming the king
close to the 2D values.

Figure 111 shows examples of using blocking to hem[]{.indexref
entry="hem:Restricting a kingâs options by blocking potential moves."}
the king, for the corner, edge, and face scenarios.

![[]{#_Ref74844246 .anchor}Figure 111: King Hemming Against Corner,
Edge, or
Face](media/image112.png){alt="A picture containing diagram Description automatically generated"
width="6.458333333333333in" height="4.597222222222222in"}

Shown are three of the four hemming situations in 3D. The king can be
hemmed[]{.indexref
entry="hemmed:Restricting a kingâs options by blocking potential moves."}
in the corner with just 4 pieces (a), along an edge with just 6 (b), and
against a face with just 8 (c). The source tile decorator under the
kings is shown, as are those for the unoccupied adjacent tiles. In the
corner, 2 face tiles and 1 edge tile are unoccupied but blocked. Along
an edge, 3 face tiles and 2 edge tiles, but still no vertex tiles are
unoccupied but blocked. Against a face, 4 face tiles, 4 edge tiles, and
1 vertex tile are unoccupied but blocked. Note that pieces on edge tiles
may block both rook and bishop advances. Other optimal solutions exist
for (b) and (c).

For the case where the king is in the open, the linear rook-like moves
can be blocked by placing pieces on *three* adjacent face tiles, one in
each direction. All the linear bishop-like moves can be blocked by
placing pieces on *four* adjacent edge tiles, all in one orthogonal
plane. All the linear duke-like moves can be blocked by placing pieces
on *four* adjacent vertex tiles framing a tetrahedron. Therefore, it
appears to require 11 pieces to hem[]{.indexref
entry="hem:Restricting a kingâs options by blocking potential moves."}
in the king in the open, just 3 more than in 2D. For the king against a
face or on an edge, 8 or 6 versus 5, an average of just 2 more than in
2D. For the king in the corner, it takes 4 pieces, just 1 more than in
2D.

Figure 112 shows the critical placement of pieces to hem[]{.indexref
entry="hem:Restricting a kingâs options by blocking potential moves."}
the king in the open by blocking his escape routes, focusing on each
type of base piece, or if you will, each type of adjacent tile.

![[]{#_Ref74846296 .anchor}Figure 112: King Hemming in the
Open](media/image113.png){alt="A close-up of a map Description automatically generated with medium confidence"
width="4.96in" height="5.34in"}

It takes just 3 pieces to prevent a king in the open from making any
rook-like advances (a), just 4 to prevent it from making any bishop-like
advances (b), and also just 4 to prevent it from making any duke-like
advances (c). If the pieces are carefully placed, some of the pieces
blocking bishop-like advances also block rook-like ones, requiring only
6 to block both (d). Linear decorators show the corresponding open tiles
which are nonetheless blocked because of the adjacent pieces. Despite 26
adjacent cells a king in the open can be fully blocked with as few as 10
pieces, compared with 8 in 2D, a surprisingly small difference.

However, pieces which block bishop-like advances also block some of the
rook-like advances, often all of them in one plane. Thus, placing just
two additional pieces, will also block the rest of the rook-like moves
in the other pair of planes. That's just 6 pieces to block both
rook-like and bishop-like advances. Adding in the 4 pieces required to
block duke-like advances, the surprising result is that it can take just
10, judiciously placed pieces, to fully hem[]{.indexref
entry="hem:Restricting a kingâs options by blocking potential moves."}
the king in even in the open. This is rather surprising, and critical
for the midgame and endgames to feel like chess. The quest for *one
right rule set* just passed another potential pitfall.

### Fencing

The other way to reduce the king's options is by threatening the tiles
adjacent to him. In the context of chess, a *fence*[]{.indexref
entry="fence:An attempt to confine a king to a portion of the board."}
is the attempt to use one piece to limit the movement of another. This
is most applicable against pawns and kings. In both 2D and 3D, the rook
move is an effective fence[]{.indexref
entry="fence:An attempt to confine a king to a portion of the board."},
neither pawn nor king can cross it; the pawn without coming under
attack, the king not at all since it is illegal for it to move into
check. The rook move cleaves the board.

All the pieces can take options away from the king this way, but the
rook's attack is the most effective way to *fence*[]{.indexref
entry="fence:A line or plane of covered tiles restricting the advance of some piece."}
in the king. We'll consider the endgame where White is attempting to
fence[]{.indexref
entry="fence:A line or plane of covered tiles restricting the advance of some piece."}
the Black king with one or two rooks.

Figure 113 shows a king in the open, in both 2D and 3D, with a rook
carefully placed so as to fence[]{.indexref
entry="fence:A line or plane of covered tiles restricting the advance of some piece."}
the king[]{.indexref
entry="degrees of freedom:How many pieces it takes to block a kingâs move."}.
In 2D, the rook has removed 3 of the 9 possible options of the king, a
1/3 reduction (a). Indeed, it has placed the king in a situation
identical to what it would be in if it was along a side of the board. A
single rook has been able to reduce an []{#open_position .anchor}*open
position*[]{.indexref
entry="open position:King is in the open, has 26 adjacent tiles on the board, (8 in 2D)."}
to a []{#side_position .anchor}*side position*[]{.indexref
entry="side position:King is on a side of the board, 5 adjacent tiles, 2D only."}.

In 3D, the rook has removed 9 of the 27 possible options of the king,
also a 1/3 reduction (b). Indeed, it has placed the king in a situation
identical to what it would be in if it was along a face of the board. A
single rook has been able to reduce an *open position*[]{.indexref
entry="open position:King is in the open, has 26 adjacent tiles on the board, (8 in 2D)."}
to a []{#face_position .anchor}*face position*[]{.indexref
entry="face position:King is on a face of the board, 17 adjacent tiles, 3D only."}.

In both games, the king has been []{#deflated
.anchor}*deflated*[]{.indexref
entry="deflated:Kingâs position has become more constrained, (ex: face to edge)."}
one level.

![[]{#_Ref71476734 .anchor}Figure 113: King Fenced by Single
Rook](media/image114.png){alt="Shape Description automatically generated with low confidence"
width="6.5in" height="7.33125in"}

A rook fences a king by threatening its adjacent tiles. A single rook
reduces the king's options by a line of 3 tiles in 2D (a) and by a
square of 9 tiles in 3D (b), in both cases reducing the king's options
by 1/3. The king's position has been *deflated* from an open position to
a side position (2D) or a face position (3D). The type of tile in the
rook plane is not significant for this analysis, but the rook decorators
for end and apex tiles have been used anyway, for consistency.

Figure 114 shows the same situation with the 3D rook in a slightly
different location so that it fences the 3D king in two dimensions. It
has removed 15 of the 27 possible options of the king, reducing it to an
[]{#edge_position .anchor}*edge position*[]{.indexref
entry="edge position:King is on an edge of the board, 11 tiles open, 3D only."},
a 55% reduction (b). The king has been deflated[]{.indexref
entry="deflated:Kingâs position has become more constrained, (ex: face to edge)."}
two levels, from open to edge.

There is no way for a single rook in 2D to achieve this same level of
deflation. You might say there is not enough resolution in two
dimensions.

In both these figures, the standard decorators for rook end, apex, and
body tiles have been used. In the next figure, their use transitions to
emphasize the intersection of the rook planes.

![[]{#_Ref71476746 .anchor}Figure 114: King Deflated Two
Levels](media/image115.png){alt="A picture containing shape Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="7.33125in"}

A carefully positioned 3D rook can fence[]{.indexref
entry="fence:A line or plane of covered tiles restricting the advance of some piece."}
a king by threatening his adjacent tiles in two dimensions, reducing the
king's options by 55% (b). There is not enough resolution to do this in
2D, (reduction is only 33%). The king's position has been *deflated*
from an open position to an edge position[]{.indexref
entry="edge position:King is on an edge of the board, 11 tiles open, 3D only."}.
For a single rook to fence a king in two dimensions, the intersection of
two of its planes must pass through an edge tile and two vertex tiles
adjacent to the king; in this case the 4,4 vertical column.

In 3D, a single carefully placed rook can fence[]{.indexref
entry="fence:A line or plane of covered tiles restricting the advance of some piece."}
the king to a stronger degree than a single rook can in 2D; 55% versus
33%.

Figure 115 shows a similar situation but now with two rooks. In 2D, the
pair of rooks have removed 5 of the 9 possible options of the king, a
55% reduction (a). They have placed the king in a situation identical to
what it would be in if it were in the corner of the board.

In 3D, the pair of rooks have removed 19 of the 27 possible options of
the king, a 70% reduction (b), deflating it all the way down to a corner
position. They too have placed the king in a situation identical to what
it would be in if it were in the corner of the board.

A pair of rooks, in either 2D or 3D, can reduce an open
position[]{.indexref
entry="open position:King is in the open, has 26 adjacent tiles on the board, (8 in 2D)."}
to a []{#corner_position .anchor}*corner position*[]{.indexref
entry="corner position:King is in a corner of the board, 7 adjacent tiles, (3 in 2D)."}.
In both cases the king has been []{#fully_deflated .anchor}*fully
deflated*[]{.indexref
entry="deflated:Kingâs position has become more constrained, (ex: face to edge)."}.

![[]{#_Ref71476763 .anchor}Figure 115: King Fenced by A Pair of
Rooks](media/image116.png){alt="A picture containing shape Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="7.33125in"}

A pair of rooks can fence[]{.indexref
entry="fence:A line or plane of covered tiles restricting the advance of some piece."}
a king by threatening its adjacent tiles in all dimensions. The pair
reduces the king's options in two lines (5 tiles) in 2D by 55% (a), and
in two squares (19 tiles) in 3D by 70% (b). The king's position has been
*fully deflated*[]{.indexref
entry="fully deflated:King deflated from open position or less to corner position."}
from an open position to a corner position[]{.indexref
entry="corner position:King is in a corner of the board, 7 adjacent tiles, (3 in 2D)."}.
Decorator use has changed to emphasize the intersection of the rook
planes.

Despite the king's significantly larger move options in 3D, both a
single rook and a pair of rooks can use fencing to reduce the king's
options by an even larger amount than in 2D. This is a promising
development; between the effectiveness of fencing and hemming, the fact
that a king can access 26 tiles in 3D, where in 2D it could only access
8, is much less of a concern. Deflation happens faster in 3D and hemming
reduces the degrees of freedom to near 2D levels. This should be enough
to yield play that *feels like chess*.

Indeed, a rook and a king can checkmate a lone king in 3D with *exactly
the same* algorithm as in 2D.

### Check

Check is the same in both 2D and 3D. A king under attack must get out of
check. It may have any of three options; move, block[]{.indexref
entry="block:Blocks cover, prevents a piece from moving to a desired location."}
the attack, or capture the attacking piece.

[]{#_Toc210218275 .anchor}Congruent Rule : **A king under attack is in
check, and it must get out of check.**

[]{#_Toc210218276 .anchor}Congruent Rule : **If a king cannot get out of
check, the game is over, and that player lost.**

### Shape

Since the king has equal access in all directions, a round shape makes
sense, but a sphere is squat and fat, hardly regal, so a tall cylinder
was chosen as the shape of the king. The 26 adjacent tiles,
particularly, on a vertically elongated board as in the figures used
here is at least a little bit suggestive of a tall stately shape.

### Power Projection

The king has 26 adjacent tiles; he sits in the center of a cube, 3x3x3 =
27, so one less is 26.

- The rook has 12 quadrants. Both the 6 end tiles (face tiles) and the
  12 apex[]{.indexref
  entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."}
  tiles are all adjacent tiles (edge tiles, brook tiles actually).

- The bishop has 24 quadrants. The 12 end tiles are obviously all
  adjacent tiles (edge tiles), but the 24 apex[]{.indexref
  entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."}
  tiles are not.

- The duke[]{.indexref
  entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."} also has
  24 quadrants. The 8 end tiles are obviously all adjacent tiles (corner
  tiles), but there are only 18 apex/duplex[]{.indexref
  entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."}
  tiles; 12 for the edge quadrants (apex)[]{.indexref
  entry="edge quadrant:A duke quadrant headed towards an edge of the board."},
  yet just 6 for the face quadrants (duplex)[]{.indexref
  entry="face quadrant:A duke quadrant headed towards a face of the board."}
  because they are shared by the cross planes[]{.indexref
  entry="cross planes:Duke planes come in planes connecting opposing board faces."}.

Let's add it up.

Adjacent tiles -- R + B + D (end tiles) = 6 + 12 + 8 = 26, check.

Beyond adjacent; R + B + D (apex[]{.indexref
entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."}
tiles) = 0 + 24 + 18 = 42.

In 2D, all nearest neighbors are adjacent tiles and moving to them is
the smallest possible step; thus, there are only 8 tiles the king can
reach in one move; with 64 squares on the board that's a PPR[]{.indexref
entry="PPR:Power projection ratio, portion of the board reachable in 1 move."}
of 8/63 = 12.7%.

In 3D, there are 26 nearest neighbors that are adjacent tiles and
another 42 apex tiles that are beyond the adjacent tiles, but still on
perimeter 1. The adjacent and linear rules allow the king access to just
the 26 nearest neighbors, which for given the 512 tiles on the 3D board
yields a PPR[]{.indexref
entry="PPR:Power projection ratio, portion of the board reachable in 1 move."}
of 26/511 = 5.09%, substantially lower than the 2D value. For the
natural rule, the 42 apex tiles increase the king's reach to 68 tiles,
which yields a PPR[]{.indexref
entry="PPR:Power projection ratio, portion of the board reachable in 1 move."}
of 68/511 = 13.3%, very close to the 2D value. Nonetheless, the natural
rule breaks too many endgames.

  (PPR**[]{.indexref
  entry="PPR:Power projection ratio, portion of the board reachable in 1 move."}**)
  -- Rook thru King**

Since the king is more a defensive piece than an offensive one, the
reduction in its power projection is a less significant factor than the
increase in its degrees of freedom. Then final determinant is of course
game play, which rule feels most like chess. Our best guess at this
point is the linear rule.

### Review

In previous discoveries a *degenerate rule* came down to one being
correct and the other not. In the case of the king, there were also two
degenerate rules[]{.indexref
entry="degenerate rules:Equivalent in a lower abstraction but different in a higher abstraction."}
in 2D, but it wasn't the case that one was right and the other wrong.
The correct rule was that *both* applied. This was hidden in 2D chess
because either rule by itself was sufficient to describe correct
behavior but the fact that the two rules were actually []{#coupled
.anchor}*coupled*[]{.indexref
entry="couple:Knight couples to the board as the anti-queen, anti to all base pieces."}
didn't become apparent until the promotion to 3D.

The king is best described as a *restricted queen*; restricted in
*range* to the smallest possible step, but also restricted to just *one
type* of advancement manifold, the *last rung* on the *advancement
manifold ladder*. In the case of 3D chess, these restrictions mean the
king is only allowed to advance via *linear moves* to *perimeter 1*.
This grants the king a *3D nature*, but automatically limits him to
*adjacent tiles*, preserving both openings and endgames.

Even though each move is in an *advancement rectangle*, pieces on tiles
that extend beyond the adjacent tiles *block*[]{.indexref
entry="block:Blocks cover, prevents a piece from moving to a desired location."}
the king, despite that the king can *neither advance* to *nor capture*
to them. The out-of-range tiles are either *bishop apex tiles*, *duke
apex or duplex tiles*, Furthermore, even though rook apex tiles are in
range adjacent tiles, the king may not advance to them a rook. This is
the *linear rule*.

The linear rule restrains the expected increase in the king's *degrees
of freedom* to just a bit more than in 2D allowing relative few pieces
to *hem* the king.

The rook can effectively *fence*[]{.indexref
entry="fence:A line or plane of covered tiles restricting the advance of some piece."}
the king, *deflating* it. Between effective hemming and effective
fencing, the king's behavior, and response to threats on the 3D board
look to be comparable to those in 2D. This is critical if play is going
to truly *feel like chess*.

### Grand Review

It should be apparent that there are several themes which support the
quest of this book to find the *one right rule set* for playing chess in
three dimensions. So far, we have encountered four supporting themes;
the ascendancy of discovery over invention, honoring or shunning
invariants, identifying limiting paradigms, and selecting between
degenerate rules[]{.indexref
entry="degenerate rules:Equivalent in a lower abstraction but different in a higher abstraction."}.
These are all specific techniques for attacking the problem of hidden
assumptions.

The depth and number of ways assumptions bias our reasoning and restrict
our thinking, even in something as simple as chess, is truly humbling
and a little frightening; chess is just a game. Real life offers more
severe penalties for overlooking hidden assumptions.

It is my hope that this line of development has inspired the Intrepid
Reader[^39] with a deeper appreciation for the power of paradigms and
emboldened you to confidently tackle them. A few techniques have been
used in this development, there are many others, and it is a learnable
skill. If so, then your investment in following this quest has already
paid off.

Now for the teaser, we are just getting started. The consequences of
these rules will challenge our thinking in additional ways. But first we
must be disciplined and complete the next two rules.

## En Passant

Allowing the pawn, a double advance on its first move is a balance rule;
it facilitates early development of the pieces. However, it comes with a
downside; the possibility of a pawn in an adjacent file to slip past an
opposing pawn that would have had the opportunity to capture it had it
made only a single advance.

### Another Balance Rule

To compensate for this quirk, another balance rule exists,
[]{#en_passant .anchor}*en passant*[]{.indexref
entry="en passant:Balance rule allowing PxP to a tile where it would have been."},
which allows an opposing pawn, on the very next move only, to capture a
pawn which has just made a double advance, by moving, not to where the
pawn *is*, but to where it *would have been* had it made only a single
advance. This applies only to pawn takes pawn.

It is almost an invariant in 2D chess that two opposing pawns in
adjacent files, when they survive long enough, will at some point in the
game each be in a position to capture the other. En passant is the only
exception, and it could be argued that it exists in part to maintain
this invariant.

3D chess already violates this invariant because a pair of pawns on
adjacent levels can avoid ever attacking each other simply by advancing
far enough off the primary plane[]{.indexref
entry="primary plane:Largest major plane, contains starting lineup & promotion tiles."}.
There is a cost to this maneuver, however, one or both now have to deal
with promotion molasses[]{.indexref
entry="promotion molasses:Without apex moves, pawns can require 12 moves to promote."}.
However, if they don't stray too far, en passant[]{.indexref
entry="en passant:Balance rule allowing PxP to a tile where it would have been."}
is possible.

In 2D, an opposing pawn on rank 5 is in position to make an en
passant[]{.indexref
entry="en passant:Balance rule allowing PxP to a tile where it would have been."}
move if either adjacent pawn makes a double advance. The situation in 3D
is richer; delightfully so.

There are four differences with 2D:

1.  The pawns can be in *12* different relative positions; for one
    attacker.

2.  Additional en passants are possible only if there are *two*
    attacking pawns involved.

3.  The opposing pawn may have both en passant[]{.indexref
    entry="en passant:Balance rule allowing PxP to a tile where it would have been."}
    *and* regular capture options.

4.  The advancing pawn may have some double advances subject to en
    passant[]{.indexref
    entry="en passant:Balance rule allowing PxP to a tile where it would have been."}
    and some not.

Each of these differences will have to be considered.

### Pawn Paths

There are three types of double advances. Each implies a different
'path' that the advancing pawn would have taken had it made two single
advances.

In this case, 'path' has a more restrictive meaning than a trajectory;
it is not a sequence of tiles, but rather a sequence of two single
advances. Call this a []{#pawn_path .anchor}*pawn path*[]{.indexref
entry="pawn path:Path a pawn makes when making two successive single advances."}.
This means that if the pawn double advanced to the apex tile, it's first
single advance would also have had to be to the earlier apex tile, so
there is only one pawn path[]{.indexref
entry="pawn path:Path a pawn makes when making two successive single advances."}.
Similarly, if the pawn double advanced to an end tile (promotion
molasses[]{.indexref
entry="promotion molasses:Without apex moves, pawns can require 12 moves to promote."})
then its first single advance would have had to have been to the earlier
end tile, so there is again only one pawn path[]{.indexref
entry="pawn path:Path a pawn makes when making two successive single advances."}.

Between the apex tile and the end tiles are two other tiles also on the
perimeter of the 3x3 advancement square of the double advance. Give them
the label *between* *tile*[]{.indexref
entry="between tile:The pair of tiles between apex and end tiles for a pawn double advance."}.

Only if the pawn makes a double advance to a between tile[]{.indexref
entry="between tile:The pair of tiles between apex and end tiles for a pawn double advance."}
does it have two paths. Either it made a single advance to an apex tile
followed by a single advance to an end tile, or it made a single advance
to an end tile and then a single advance to an apex tile. The earlier
apex tile and the earlier end tile are []{#path_tiles .anchor}*path
tiles*. Both path tiles must be covered for en passant[]{.indexref
entry="en passant:Balance rule allowing PxP to a tile where it would have been."}
to be an option.

Figure 116 shows 3 pairs of snapshots of the pawn paths of a double pawn
advance. Only if the advancing pawn moves to a between tile[]{.indexref
entry="between tile:The pair of tiles between apex and end tiles for a pawn double advance."}
does it have more than one path. In this case, en passant[]{.indexref
entry="en passant:Balance rule allowing PxP to a tile where it would have been."}
is only possible if the opposing pawn(s) had options for capturing to
*both* of the path tiles. In that case, the opposing player also has the
choice of which of the two path tiles to capture to.

![[]{#_Ref63260349 .anchor}Figure 116: En Passant
Paths](media/image117.png){alt="A picture containing text Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="4.541666666666667in"}

A pawn which makes a double advance to the apex tile, or to one of the
two end tiles, has only one possible path: through the single move apex
tile (a), or through the single move end tile (b), respectively.
However, it has two possible paths to the between tiles; either an end
tile advance followed by an apex advance, or an apex advance followed by
an end tile advance (c). In the latter case, capture by en
passant[]{.indexref
entry="en passant:Balance rule allowing PxP to a tile where it would have been."}
is possible only if both path tiles are covered. The path tiles are at
2,3, (or 3,2) and 3,3. This also means the opposing player has the
option of which path tile[]{.indexref
entry="path tile:The fictious tiles a pawn travels through in a double advance."}
to capture upon. Ghost pawns show the destination tile of the double
advance and the path tile[]{.indexref
entry="path tile:The fictious tiles a pawn travels through in a double advance."}(s)
of the single advance. Note that the 2x2 advancement squares partially
overlap, so the decorators shown are for the later single advance of
those tiles.

### Apex Tile En Passants

Figure 117 shows the 3D case most like the 2D one. White's pawn (KB2,2)
has made a double apex advance to KB4,4. Both of Black's pawns (KN5,5 &
K5,5) can attack the single apex advance tile (KB6,6) via pawn-duke
direct[]{.indexref
entry="direct:Linear moves with two virtual quadrants reduce to a single end tile."}
capture[]{.indexref
entry="direct capture:Pawn capture as a duke linear move with two virtual quadrants."}.
Being direct[]{.indexref
entry="direct:Linear moves with two virtual quadrants reduce to a single end tile."}
moves, there are no advancement squares for these Black pawn captures,
just the 3x3 advancement square for the White pawn's double advance.

![[]{#_Ref63277222 .anchor}Figure 117: En Passant Apex-Direct
Capture](media/image118.png){alt="A picture containing text, checker Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="3.936111111111111in"}

The White pawn has made a double advance to the apex tile, and both
Black pawns, one above, one below, can make an en passant[]{.indexref
entry="en passant:Balance rule allowing PxP to a tile where it would have been."}
capture to the single advance apex tile via pawn-duke
*direct*[]{.indexref
entry="direct:Linear moves with two virtual quadrants reduce to a single end tile."}
capture[]{.indexref
entry="direct capture:Pawn capture as a duke linear move with two virtual quadrants."}.
Ghost pawns show the legal moves. This is the situation most like the
case in 2D; all the pieces and moves are in the primary
plane[]{.indexref
entry="primary plane:Largest major plane, contains starting lineup & promotion tiles."}.
Note the offset pair of pawn-duke decorators indicating that two
different pieces are attacking the same tile.

Just as in 2D, it is possible for two opposing pawns to have an en
passant[]{.indexref
entry="en passant:Balance rule allowing PxP to a tile where it would have been."}
option at the same time on the same advancing pawn; one on one side
(level), one on the other.

Figure 118 shows four Black pawns with en passant[]{.indexref
entry="en passant:Balance rule allowing PxP to a tile where it would have been."}
attacks on the single apex tile. This is the same White pawn as in the
previous figure, and same advance, just facing a different set of
opposing Black pawns. All are pawn-bishop apex captures; two predators
(both forward planes) and two slings (both outward planes). However, in
a twist not possible in 2D, the two nearest Black pawns also have the
option of capturing the White pawn at its double apex position via the
pawn-bishop reduced capture[]{.indexref
entry="reduced capture:Pawn capture to a bishop edge tile one level away."};
not an en passant[]{.indexref
entry="en passant:Balance rule allowing PxP to a tile where it would have been."}
capture all.

In the three previous figures, the White pawn has had no attack on the
opposing Black pawn(s). Five of the six pawn captures have been seen:
direct[]{.indexref
entry="direct:Linear moves with two virtual quadrants reduce to a single end tile."},
sling, predator, dart and bead[]{.indexref
entry="bead:Pawn capture as a linear bishop move diagonally in front."},
although the bead[]{.indexref
entry="bead:Pawn capture as a linear bishop move diagonally in front."}
attack was a regular attack not an en passant[]{.indexref

attack. Indeed the pawn-bishop bead[]{.indexref

attack can never be used en passant[]{.indexref
entry="en passant:Balance rule allowing PxP to a tile where it would have been."}.

Figure 120 shows two Black pawns with en passant[]{.indexref

Ghost pawns show the legal moves. Note that the White pawn could have
captured either Black pawn via *sling* instead of making the double
advance, and in perfect symmetry both Black pawns were attacking the
White pawn via sling as well. Note the offset pawn-bishop decorators
indicating that multiple different pieces are attacking the same tile.

However, in a twist not possible in 2D, White had the option of
capturing either Black pawn instead of making the double advance. On a
material exchange bases, it was what she should have done; however,
sacrificing a piece to gain initiative, or speed development, or just
set a trap are very chess like considerations.

### End Tile En Passants

The proceeding four figures showed, in nearly exhaustive detail, how en
passant[]{.indexref
entry="en passant:Balance rule allowing PxP to a tile where it would have been."}
looks when the double advance is made to an apex tile. The case for a
double advance to an end tile is similar, but there are a couple of
differences.

Figure 121 shows the White pawn (KB2,2) having made a double end advance
to the left second end tile (KB4,2). This is the same White pawn as in
the previous figures, but different advance, facing two opposing Black
pawns. Both of Black's pawns (KN5,6 & K5,6) can attack the single end
advance tile (KB6,7) via pawn-duke direct[]{.indexref
entry="direct:Linear moves with two virtual quadrants reduce to a single end tile."}
capture[]{.indexref
entry="direct capture:Pawn capture as a duke linear move with two virtual quadrants."}.
Being direct[]{.indexref
entry="direct:Linear moves with two virtual quadrants reduce to a single end tile."}
moves, there are no advancement squares for the Black pawn captures.
However, they also had pawn-bishop attacks on both the original location
of the White pawn (2,2) via sling capture, but also on its double
advance destination (4,2) via reduced capture. Instead of a double
advance, White should have captured either pawn via sling (both outward
planes) rather than be humiliated like this.

![[]{#_Ref63329894 .anchor}Figure 121: En Passant End-Direct
Capture](media/image122.png){alt="A picture containing text, checker Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="3.936111111111111in"}

The White pawn has made a double advance to the left end tile, and both
Black pawns, one above, one below, can make an en passant[]{.indexref
entry="en passant:Balance rule allowing PxP to a tile where it would have been."}
capture to the single advance left end tile via *direct*[]{.indexref
entry="direct:Linear moves with two virtual quadrants reduce to a single end tile."}
capture[]{.indexref
entry="direct capture:Pawn capture as a duke linear move with two virtual quadrants."}.
However, Black could also have captured the pawn at the end tile via
*reduced* capture, or if it was their move even captured the White pawn
by *sling* in its original location. Look at all the advancement
squares. Ghost pawns show the legal moves. Note the offset pair of
pawn-duke and pawn-bishop decorators indicating that two different
pieces are attacking the same tile.

This nearly parallels the first example for the double advance to an
apex tile. The one difference is that in this case, the White pawn was
actually attacking both Black pawns via pawn-bishop sling
capture[]{.indexref
entry="sling capture:Pawn capture to a bishop apex tile one level away."}
prior to the double advance.

Figure 122 shows four Black pawns with en passant[]{.indexref
entry="en passant:Balance rule allowing PxP to a tile where it would have been."}
attacks on the single end tile. This is the same White pawn as in the
previous figures, and same advance, just facing a different set of
opposing Black pawns. All are pawn-bishop apex captures; two predators
(both forward planes) and two slings (both outward planes). As for the
double advance to the apex tile case, the two Black pawns one level away
also have the option of capturing the White pawn at its double end tile
position, but this time via pawn-duke direct[]{.indexref
entry="direct:Linear moves with two virtual quadrants reduce to a single end tile."}
capture[]{.indexref
entry="direct capture:Pawn capture as a duke linear move with two virtual quadrants."};
not an en passant[]{.indexref

capture all.

The White pawn has made a double advance to the left end tile, and all

capture to the single advance end tile via pawn-bishop apex captures;
two via *predator* tiles (forward planes), two by *sling* tiles (outward
planes). In addition to the four en passant[]{.indexref
entry="en passant:Balance rule allowing PxP to a tile where it would have been."}
captures, the two closet Black pawns also have regular capture moves to
the double left end tile via *direct*[]{.indexref
entry="direct:Linear moves with two virtual quadrants reduce to a single end tile."}
capture[]{.indexref
entry="direct capture:Pawn capture as a duke linear move with two virtual quadrants."}.
Ghost pawns show the legal moves. Note the offset pawn-bishop and
pawn-duke decorators indicating that multiple different pieces are
attacking the same tiles.

While all of the en passant[]{.indexref
entry="en passant:Balance rule allowing PxP to a tile where it would have been."}
attacks (four) could be blocked were there any pieces on both KN4,3 and
K4,3 (White's perspective), the two regular attacks via pawn-duke
direct[]{.indexref
entry="direct:Linear moves with two virtual quadrants reduce to a single end tile."}
capture[]{.indexref
entry="direct capture:Pawn capture as a duke linear move with two virtual quadrants."}
cannot be blocked.

Figure 123 shows a single pawn with an en passant[]{.indexref
entry="en passant:Balance rule allowing PxP to a tile where it would have been."}
attack on the single end tile. This is the same White pawn as in the
previous figures, and same advance, facing a single opposing Black pawn,
one *on the same level*. There is no parallel for this situation in 2D
chess. The en passant[]{.indexref
entry="en passant:Balance rule allowing PxP to a tile where it would have been."}
capture is via pawn-duke dart capture[]{.indexref
entry="dart capture:Pawn capture to a duke apex tile diagonally ahead on the advance level."}.
Unlike the apex case, however, there is no regular capture to the double
end tile.

![[]{#_Ref63329926 .anchor}Figure 123: En Passant End-Dart; no Regular
Bead
Capture](media/image124.png){alt="A picture containing text, checker Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="3.936111111111111in"}

The White pawn has made a double advance to the left end tile, and the
one Black pawn, on the same level, can make an en passant[]{.indexref
entry="en passant:Balance rule allowing PxP to a tile where it would have been."}
capture to the single advance end tile via *dart* capture[]{.indexref
entry="dart capture:Pawn capture to a duke apex tile diagonally ahead on the advance level."}.
Ghost pawns show the legal moves. It has no regular captures unlike the
bead[]{.indexref
entry="bead:Pawn capture as a linear bishop move diagonally in front."}
capture[]{.indexref
entry="bead capture:Pawn capture as a linear bishop move diagonally in front."}
it had in the apex case.

In the three previous figures, four of the six pawn captures have been
seen: direct[]{.indexref
entry="direct:Linear moves with two virtual quadrants reduce to a single end tile."},
sling, predator, and dart. The pawn-bishop bead[]{.indexref
entry="bead:Pawn capture as a linear bishop move diagonally in front."}
capture[]{.indexref
entry="bead capture:Pawn capture as a linear bishop move diagonally in front."}
has no en passant[]{.indexref
entry="en passant:Balance rule allowing PxP to a tile where it would have been."}
capture, and for a double advance to an end tile it doesn't even have a
regular capture.

Figure 124 shows two Black pawns with en passant[]{.indexref
entry="en passant:Balance rule allowing PxP to a tile where it would have been."}
attacks on the single end tile. This is the same White pawn as in the
previous figures, and same advance, just facing a different set of
opposing Black pawns. All are pawn-bishop reduced captures (outward
planes).

![[]{#_Ref63329973 .anchor}Figure 124: En Passant End-Reduced
Capture](media/image125.png){alt="A picture containing text, checker Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="3.936111111111111in"}

The White pawn has made a double advance to the left end tile, and the
two Black pawns, up one level and down one level, can make an en
passant[]{.indexref
entry="en passant:Balance rule allowing PxP to a tile where it would have been."}
capture to the single advance end tile via *reduced* capture[]{.indexref
entry="reduced capture:Pawn capture to a bishop edge tile one level away."}.
Ghost pawns show the legal moves. The Black pawns are not symmetrically
placed; the upper one also has a *direct* attack on the White pawn,
which by symmetry it also has in return, so it could have captured the
upper pawn instead of making the double advance. Note the offset
pawn-bishop decorators indicating that multiple different pieces are
attacking the same tile.

As in the apex case, White had the option of capturing the upper Black
pawn instead of making the double advance. However, in this case it
would have been by direct capture, and she does not have an attack on
the lower Black pawn.

In both the double apex advance and the double end advance, the White
pawn had a single path. Depending on the circumstances, Black might have
had a regular attack as well as an en passant[]{.indexref
entry="en passant:Balance rule allowing PxP to a tile where it would have been."}
attack, and even White might have had a regular attack option to her
double advance.

### Between Tile En Passants

For double advances to between tiles (the two tiles between the apex
tile and the end tiles), there are two possible pawn paths; a single
apex advance followed by a single end tile advance, or a single end tile
advance followed by a single apex advance. This means that opposing
pawns must be able to attack *both* paths for en passant[]{.indexref
entry="en passant:Balance rule allowing PxP to a tile where it would have been."}
to be legal.

Obviously, the dart and bead[]{.indexref
entry="bead:Pawn capture as a linear bishop move diagonally in front."}
attacks cannot cover both paths, for they are on each other's diagonal
and the between path tiles are connected by faces. For a single piece to
cover both paths one attack must be via pawn-duke direct[]{.indexref
entry="direct:Linear moves with two virtual quadrants reduce to a single end tile."}
capture[]{.indexref
entry="direct capture:Pawn capture as a duke linear move with two virtual quadrants."}
and the other by either sling or reduced capture[]{.indexref
entry="reduced capture:Pawn capture to a bishop edge tile one level away."}.

Figure 125 shows both attacks. The knight pawn threatens the apex tile
via a reduced attack and the end tile via a direct[]{.indexref
entry="direct:Linear moves with two virtual quadrants reduce to a single end tile."}
attack. Note that White could have sling captured this pawn rather than
making a double advance. The king pawn threatens the apex tile via a
pawn-duke direct[]{.indexref
entry="direct:Linear moves with two virtual quadrants reduce to a single end tile."}
attack and the end tile via a sling attack. It also has a regular attack
on the between tile[]{.indexref
entry="between tile:The pair of tiles between apex and end tiles for a pawn double advance."}
via reduced capture[]{.indexref
entry="reduced capture:Pawn capture to a bishop edge tile one level away."}.

![[]{#_Ref63345646 .anchor}Figure 125: En Passant Between-Direct and
Between-Reduced or Between-Sling
Capture](media/image126.png){alt="A picture containing text, checker Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="3.936111111111111in"}

For a single pawn to cover both paths of a between tile[]{.indexref
entry="between tile:The pair of tiles between apex and end tiles for a pawn double advance."}
double advance, one attack must be *direct*[]{.indexref
entry="direct:Linear moves with two virtual quadrants reduce to a single end tile."},
and the other either *reduced* or *sling*. If the direct attack is
paired with reduced (knight pawn), it might have captured the advancing
pawn via sling prior to its advance, and if paired with sling (king
pawn), it could have just captured the pawn in its new location via
reduced. Ghost pawns indicate legal moves. Offset decorators indicate
different pieces attacking the same tile.

When a single piece covers both path tiles, it has the option of moving
to either one.

Figure 126 shows the situation where two different pawns cover both path
tiles between them. In this case, the two pawns are two levels away, in
opposite directions. Cover[]{.indexref
entry="Cover:A tile a piece can reach, or a foe it can attack, or a friend it can defend."}
is by pawn-bishop predator capture[]{.indexref
entry="predator capture:Pawn capture to a bishop apex tile two levels away."}.

![[]{#_Ref63345655 .anchor}Figure 126: En Passant of Between-Tile
Between Two
Predators](media/image127.png){alt="A picture containing text, checker Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="3.936111111111111in"}

These two opposing pawns cover both path tiles of a between double
advance. Note that they are not symmetrically placed. Each Black pawn
covers one of the path tiles; the rook pawn covers the single advance
apex tile (KB6,6) and the queen pawn covers the single advance end tile
(KB6,7). Both covers are by *predator* capture[]{.indexref
entry="predator capture:Pawn capture to a bishop apex tile two levels away."}.
Ghost pawns indicate the legal moves.

All the pawn captures except the bead[]{.indexref
entry="bead:Pawn capture as a linear bishop move diagonally in front."}
can participate in en passant[]{.indexref
entry="en passant:Balance rule allowing PxP to a tile where it would have been."}.
That leaves 13 possible attacks per pawn. For two pawns that's 169
permutations. Some of these will have regular attacks as well as en
passant[]{.indexref
entry="en passant:Balance rule allowing PxP to a tile where it would have been."}
attacks, and some of them will offer a counter capture in lieu of the
double advance. They have not been exhaustively studied. It is also
likely that a few will have one pawn blocking the other, so not all 169
permutations may work. 150 makes a reasonable round number estimate. Add
in the apex and end tile situations, 13 each, plus the 4 cases where one
pawn could in fact capture to both between paths and that's nearly 200
permutations.

The easier way to think about it, however, is that each opposing pawn
has 5 different types of attacks that are compatible with en
passant[]{.indexref
entry="en passant:Balance rule allowing PxP to a tile where it would have been."}.
For apex and end tile double advances, if any of those cover the
*single* path tile[]{.indexref
entry="path tile:The fictious tiles a pawn travels through in a double advance."},
then the opposing pawn has an en passant[]{.indexref
entry="en passant:Balance rule allowing PxP to a tile where it would have been."}
option. That's just 10 permutations. For the between double advance,
there are only 2 ways a single pawn can cover both path tiles and then
the two options of which path tile to capture to. When a pair of pawns
cover different path tiles, there are the same 5 different types of
attack for each, that's another 25 permutations. En passants with three
or more pawns will be left to the discretion of the Intrepid Reader, but
in truth it's just more of the same.

For the rest of the nuances (double advance regular attack, pawn capture
possible before the double advance), those would be considerations even
if en passant[]{.indexref
entry="en passant:Balance rule allowing PxP to a tile where it would have been."}
were not allowed.

### Rule Ambiguity

A more interesting question is whether the en passant[]{.indexref
entry="en passant:Balance rule allowing PxP to a tile where it would have been."}
rule should be more restrictive and require that a single piece covers
both path tiles. There are two arguments for why the less restrictive
rule, which allows two different pawns to cover the path tiles, should
be considered the proper en passant[]{.indexref
entry="en passant:Balance rule allowing PxP to a tile where it would have been."}
rule.

First, the rationale for en passant[]{.indexref
entry="en passant:Balance rule allowing PxP to a tile where it would have been."}
is based on the concept of a fictitious history; had the advancing pawn
made *two single* advances instead of *one double* advance, what would
the opponent's options have been. Clearly, in both fictitious histories,
the opposition had a potential capture, just not from the same piece.

Second, the expectation is that this game will be mostly played with
computer assistance, an IA program will help players visualize legal
moves, present a board, and enforce the rules. Therefore, one of the
tenants of the discovery criteria is that when there are two competing
possibilities, it is best to allow the less restrictive rule set. The
argument is that if the players wish to play by the more restrictive
rule set, they can simply agree to do so; the computer will be no wiser.
However, if the restrictive rules set is programmed, and the players
attempt to play by the less restrictive rules, then the computer will
prevent such moves. Not very friendly.

In either case, the single pawn double pawn (*SPDP*) en
passant[]{.indexref
entry="en passant:Balance rule allowing PxP to a tile where it would have been."}
rule falls under the category of a balance rule (of which en
passant[]{.indexref
entry="en passant:Balance rule allowing PxP to a tile where it would have been."}
is people's exhibit A anyway) and an appeal to an analytical resolution
is inherently weak given the complexity. The accumulation of many, many
hours of play is the correct approach to determining which way the rule
should go.

Either way, for a double advance to a between tile[]{.indexref
entry="between tile:The pair of tiles between apex and end tiles for a pawn double advance."},
both path tiles must be covered, else the player of the advancing pawn
could simply argue that in the fictitious history, they took the
unthreatened route.

### Contrast with 2D

In 2D, when a double advance is made, only two files have to be
considered and a max of one pawn on each. Usually, only one pawn has an
en passant[]{.indexref
entry="en passant:Balance rule allowing PxP to a tile where it would have been."}
attack, but it is not uncommon for two pawns, one in each file, to have
en passant[]{.indexref
entry="en passant:Balance rule allowing PxP to a tile where it would have been."}
attacks. In that case, either pawn may perform the capture.

In 3D, when a double advance is made, five levels have to be considered
(including, counter intuitively, the level on which the double advance
occurred). Furthermore, there can be more than one pawn on a level which
must be considered.

Figure 127 shows an example where two pawns on the same level are able
to cover a double advance to a between tile[]{.indexref
entry="between tile:The pair of tiles between apex and end tiles for a pawn double advance."}.
Both are using the pawn-bishop predator attack.

![[]{#_Ref63347325 .anchor}Figure 127: En Passant of Between Tile via
Two Pieces on Same
Level](media/image128.png){alt="A screenshot of a video game Description automatically generated with low confidence"
width="6.5in" height="3.936111111111111in"}

It is possible for two pawns on the same level to both have en
passant[]{.indexref
entry="en passant:Balance rule allowing PxP to a tile where it would have been."}
attacks. Shown here is a double advance by White from KB2,2 to KB4,3, a
between tile[]{.indexref
entry="between tile:The pair of tiles between apex and end tiles for a pawn double advance."}.
Therefore, there are two path tiles which must be covered for Black to
have an en passant[]{.indexref
entry="en passant:Balance rule allowing PxP to a tile where it would have been."}
option. His two rook pawns indeed cover both path tiles (*predator*),
and he may execute an en passant[]{.indexref
entry="en passant:Balance rule allowing PxP to a tile where it would have been."}
capture by moving one or the other to the path tile[]{.indexref
entry="path tile:The fictious tiles a pawn travels through in a double advance."}
that particular Black pawn covers. Ghost pawns indicate legal moves.

If a player makes a double advance, one side effect is that it places a
computation load on the opponent -- so many pieces to check and
evaluate.

### Congruent Rules

The preference is for short pithy expressions for the congruent rules.
When it comes to en passant[]{.indexref
entry="en passant:Balance rule allowing PxP to a tile where it would have been."},
that turns out to be a bit difficult; getting it down to one line wasn't
possible.

[]{#_Toc210218277 .anchor}Congruent Rule : **An opposing *pawn*, on the
*next move only*, may capture a *doubly advanced* pawn *en
passant***[]{.indexref
entry="en passant:Balance rule allowing PxP to a tile where it would have been."}
**by moving to a covered *path tile***[]{.indexref
entry="path tile:The fictious tiles a pawn travels through in a double advance."}**,
if *all* path tiles were covered by *one or more* pawns.**

Other pieces cannot capture via en passant[]{.indexref
entry="en passant:Balance rule allowing PxP to a tile where it would have been."},
it applies only to *pawn* takes pawn. It is further restricted to being
allowed only on the very *next move.* It is also restricted to when all
*path tiles are covered,* which in 2D is only one, so the congruent rule
is degenerate on that specification. When more than one path
tile[]{.indexref
entry="path tile:The fictious tiles a pawn travels through in a double advance."}
is covered, *both are valid options*; also degenerate in 2D as there is
never more than one path tile[]{.indexref
entry="path tile:The fictious tiles a pawn travels through in a double advance."}.
Implied is that if there is *more than one pawn* which can en
passant[]{.indexref
entry="en passant:Balance rule allowing PxP to a tile where it would have been."},
it is a *free choice*. Finally, the rule's clarity depends on the
concept of a *path tile*[]{.indexref
entry="path tile:The fictious tiles a pawn travels through in a double advance."}.

### Review

The rules for moving chess pieces based on the concept of base pieces is
pretty straightforward. The base pieces derive from the geometry of the
board, rays are easy to understand, and that the number of rays involved
in a move grows as the dimensions of the game grow is also reasonable.
By now, the concept of the planar move and advancement squares should
start to feel familiar and natural, the initially counter intuitive feel
replaced with a sense of mastery. You may even have gotten to the point
where the rules for 2D chess feel, well, flat.

Contrast this clarity with the consequences of allowing a balance rule
into the formalism, in this case the pawn double advance balance rule.
It had ripples; the 'where did that come from?' rule called en
passant[]{.indexref
entry="en passant:Balance rule allowing PxP to a tile where it would have been."}.
It's not too bad in 2D, but in 3D, it takes on a complexity that is
almost irritating. Here is another argument for letting the game tell us
the rules. Whenever we finite humans muck around with it, complexity
grows in unexpected ways, once again discovery is ascendant over
invention.

Since the goal is discovery, and double advance and en
passant[]{.indexref
entry="en passant:Balance rule allowing PxP to a tile where it would have been."}
are a part of 2D chess, we are stuck with it, but I wonder sometimes
what 3D play would look like if the double advance was prohibited. The
extended reach of the pawn's capture moves might be sufficient to
support rapid development in the openings.

When a double advance occurs, every nearby pawn needs to be considered
for its potential to perform an en passant[]{.indexref
entry="en passant:Balance rule allowing PxP to a tile where it would have been."}
capture. For apex and end tile double advances, only one path
tile[]{.indexref
entry="path tile:The fictious tiles a pawn travels through in a double advance."}
must be considered. For between tile[]{.indexref
entry="between tile:The pair of tiles between apex and end tiles for a pawn double advance."}
double advances two path tiles have to be considered, and en
passant[]{.indexref
entry="en passant:Balance rule allowing PxP to a tile where it would have been."}
is only possible if both are covered, but they don't have to be covered
by the same piece.

Recall that in a 3D en passant[]{.indexref
entry="en passant:Balance rule allowing PxP to a tile where it would have been."}
situation, regular captures may also be possible, and when pawns are
close enough for en passant[]{.indexref
entry="en passant:Balance rule allowing PxP to a tile where it would have been."}
to be considered, it may also have been possible for the advancing pawn
to have made a regular capture instead of the double advance.

New jargon to recall; *en passant,* *pawn paths*, and *path tiles*. Old
jargon to review; the double advance tiles, *apex*, *end*, and *between*
tiles, and the six pawn attacks, *direct*, *dart*, *predator*, *sling*,
*reduced*, and *bead*.

## Castling

In chess, there is yet another balance rule, one which permits *two
pieces to move at once* -- castling.

### Supernatural

If the objective of game design is to create fascinating complexity from
a few simple primitives, then castling is an atrocity. Its specification
does not derive from rays, base pieces, or advancement manifolds. From
the perspective of simple primitives there is nothing in the movement of
the king and rook in castling that is legal; the king moves *two* tiles
and the rook actually moves *through* the king -- castling is
*supernatural*[]{.indexref
entry="supernatural:Castling violates the most basic chess primitives, it isnât natural."}.[^40]
It is justified solely on its tactical and strategic contributions.

The supernatural nature of castling is another justification for
regarding changes of state in chess as *atomic*. The story of
intermediate steps is a convenient fiction, a myth designed to make
history more compatible with the classical behavior of physical objects.
It's a variation on the trajectory paradigm. Chess is not physical; it
is *abstract*, technically, a []{#formal_system .anchor}*formal
system*[]{.indexref
entry="formal system:Abstract system of transformations, typically typographic."}.
Pieces were here, now they're there, and they were never, ever anywhere
in between.

### Justification

Castling can be justified because it supports, simultaneously, two
important strategic concepts in chess, control of the center and defense
of the king. Because the king starts in the middle of the starting
lineup, advancing the royal pawns with the intent to control the center
has the side effect of exposing the king. Castling was invented to
maintain a balance between these two strategic objectives. It mitigates
the risk to the king when the royal pawns have advanced to the center,
and it develops a rook.

### Balance Rule

A congruent rule for castling should be dimension agnostic[]{.indexref
entry="dimension agnostic:Rules of chess which scale to higher dimensions as invariants."}
and should correctly project one dimension down. However, it should also
honor the intent of castling as a balance rule, to wit.

1.  Protect the king

2.  Develop the rook (perhaps the king as well)

3.  Respect the 2D restrictions

4.  Let the pieces express their natural manifolds as fully as
    reasonable

As a balance rule it comes with five restrictions.

1.  Neither king nor the castling rook can have *previously* *moved*.

2.  The tiles between them must be *empty*.

3.  The king cannot castle *out of* check.

4.  The king cannot castle *into* check.

5.  The king cannot castle *through* check.

### Piece Development

Piece development is the term for moving a piece from the relative
safety of the starting lineup to a position with greater coverage of the
board. It figures prominently in openings. Castling has two objectives,
safety of the king of course, but also piece development. The
development of the central pawns and the rook are obvious but --
castling *also* []{#develop .anchor}*develops the king*.

Figure 128 shows a 2D example. By executing a king-side
castle[]{.indexref entry="king-side castle:Castling on the king side."},
White uses her king to continue to defend the KR pawn from Black's
bishop attack; White has developed her king.

![[]{#_Ref63673694 .anchor}Figure 128: Castling to Develop the King in
2D](media/image129.png){alt="A close-up of a circuit board Description automatically generated with low confidence"
width="6.39in" height="1.54in"}

Castling is intended for safety and development, including developing
the king. Here, castling on the king side allows White to continue to
protect the KR pawn from Black's bishop (green decorators), but uses the
king to do so. It was previously protected by the rook.

### Rule Degeneracy

Like the rules for the base pieces, the rules for castling are
degenerate in 2D; should 3D castling be in the *orthogonal line* of the
home column[]{.indexref
entry="home line:Orthogonal line of the opponentâs starting line-up of the major pieces."},
a move *two dimensions* less than the board, or should 3D castling be in
*orthogonal planes* (the vertical back planes which intersect along the
home column), a move *one dimension* less than the board. The latter is
more consistent with the planar move idiom.

Call the former case []{#inline_castling .anchor}*inline
castling*[]{.indexref
entry="inline castling:Castling limited to the home column without advancement squares."}
and the latter case []{#planar_castling .anchor}*planar
castling*[]{.indexref
entry="planar castling:Castling occurs in the back planes with advancement manifolds."}.

### Inline Castling -- Rejected

In inline castling[]{.indexref
entry="inline castling:Castling limited to the home column without advancement squares."},
the king moves two tiles along the home column, the rook moves to the
other side (no advancement squares for either piece), and castling is
complete. Simple. One dimensional. Invokes the same supernatural move as
in 2D where the pieces move 'through' each other.

The case for inline castling[]{.indexref
entry="inline castling:Castling limited to the home column without advancement squares."}
is simplicity and understandability; all the action occurs in the
vertical straight line of the home column. However, in contrast to
planar castling[]{.indexref
entry="planar castling:Castling occurs in the back planes with advancement manifolds."},
it fails to take advantage of the extra dimension and thus development
of both king and rook is limited. As an aesthetic, the move continues to
be 100% supernatural.

Figure 129 shows an example of inline castling[]{.indexref
entry="inline castling:Castling limited to the home column without advancement squares."}
on the king side. Not much to it.

![[]{#_Ref63674295 .anchor}Figure 129: Castling Inline -
Rejected](media/image130.png){width="6.5in"
height="6.111805555555556in"}

There are no advancement squares in inline castling[]{.indexref
entry="inline castling:Castling limited to the home column without advancement squares."}
as it occurs in a space *two* dimensions less than the board, just the
vertical straight line of the home column. While simple, piece
development is highly limited. For clarity, king and rook decorators are
offset because the 'straight lines' overlap. Ghost pieces show the
destinations that would be legal if this rule were acceptable.

All previous 3D moves have added richness to the game; their 2D move
predecessors, when promoted to 3D, revealed new nuances with tactical
and strategic implications. This option does not; the promoted move is
sterile. Neither the king nor the rook utilizes planar moves, so they do
not derive from the base pieces, and thus their 3D nature is denied. On
these grounds this rule for castling is rejected.

### The Far Side Rule -- Rejected

Recall the two degenerate rules[]{.indexref
entry="degenerate rules:Equivalent in a lower abstraction but different in a higher abstraction."}
for castling; either "advance along the home line", or "advance in a
space one dimension less than the board." We shun the first and honor
the second; it is more consistent with how the base pieces move. This
means both the king and the rook move in advancement manifolds. On the
king side the rook will move in a 3x3 advancement square, while on the
queen side the rook will move in a 4x4 advancement square. In both
cases, a linear move for the rook results in an advancement rectangle
truncated to an advancement square because one quadrant is off the
board.

Castling in 2D is very often articulated as "the rook moves to the other
side of the king." If this phrasing is honored, then the rook can
advance to any tile on the far side of the perimeter, potentially out of
range of the protection of the king, even more so for queen side
castling.

Call this the []{#far_side_rule .anchor}*far side rule*[]{.indexref
entry="far side rule:King moves 2 levels, rook advances to level on other side."}.[^41]

Figure 130 shows the rejected far side rule[]{.indexref
entry="far side rule:King moves 2 levels, rook advances to level on other side."}
with White making a king side castle and Black making a queen side
castle. Ghost pieces indicate possible moves. Note that 1/3 of the king
side rook moves leave the rook unprotected by the king, a ratio which
grows to 1/2 for queen side castles.

The symmetry between king-side and queen-side castling is broken; king
side has *three* options for the rook, but queen side has *four*. In 2D,
each side has only one. Further, in 2D castling, the king protects the
castling rook; this symmetry is also broken under the far side
rule[]{.indexref
entry="far side rule:King moves 2 levels, rook advances to level on other side."}.
The extended development of the rook (particularly on the queen side)
begins to shift castling from a defensive move to an offensive one;
fails to feel like chess. For these reasons, regretfully, the far side
rule[]{.indexref
entry="far side rule:King moves 2 levels, rook advances to level on other side."}
for castling is rejected.

![[]{#_Ref80018598 .anchor}Figure 130: Castling Far Side Rule --
Rejected](media/image131.png){alt="A picture containing background pattern Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="6.402777777777778in"}

Shown are two examples of castling under the *far side rule*[]{.indexref
entry="far side rule:King moves 2 levels, rook advances to level on other side."},
where the rook has access to any tile on the perimeter of its
advancement square which is on the *far side* of the king. White makes a
king-side castle[]{.indexref
entry="king-side castle:Castling on the king side."}, which offers
*three* tiles for her rook, *one* of which is not adjacent to her king
and thus undefended (a). Black makes a queen-side castle[]{.indexref
entry="queen-side castle:Castling on the queen side."}, which offers
*four* tiles for his rook, *two* of which are not adjacent to his king
and thus undefended (b). The advancement rectangles for the kings have
been suppressed to make the rooks' moves clearer. Off board tiles and
the rooks' linear moves to the 1,1, tiles have also been suppressed.
Ghost pieces indicate the tiles that would be allowed if this move were
legal. Hollow decorators indicate blocking tiles not accessible to the
rook while castling.

### The Sidekick Rule

While true that in 2D the rook ends up on the far side of the king, it
is also true that it ends up on a tile *adjacent* to the king, where it
can be protected.

If we are very careful in our word choice, we can phrase the rules for
castling in 2D in such a way as to reveal *eight* invariants; eight
invariants which can be preserved in 3D with planar moves.

The king moves *first*, *two* *steps* like a rook *toward the side* of
the board, in any manifold that contains the entire *home line*, the
rook on the *predominant side of the king* moves supernaturally as *far
as it needs to* in order to land on an *adjacent tile* on the *other
side* of the king.

Call this the []{#sidekick_rule .anchor}*sidekick rule*[]{.indexref
entry="sidekick rule:King advances to perimeter 2, rook advances to adjacent tile, far level."}.
Think superhero and his sidekick, by his side every time, every move.

In 2D, the king makes a rook-like move two tiles away, and the castling
rook moves to an *adjacent tile* on the *other side* of the king in the
*same line*. They move in the only orthogonal advancement manifold they
share, the first rank.

In 3D, the king and rook share *two* orthogonal advancement manifolds,
the two vertical back planes.[^42] The king has four possible linear
rook-like moves; advance *up two tiles* ([]{#king_side_castle
.anchor}*king-side castle*[]{.indexref
entry="king-side castle:Castling on the king side."}) or *down two
tiles* ([]{#queen_side_castle .anchor}*queen-side castle*[]{.indexref
entry="queen-side castle:Castling on the queen side."}) or advance *out
two tiles* in *either back plane*. Therefore, in 3D, the king has *four*
unique possible moves; in 2D, only *two*.

We'll consider the up and down cases first, the []{#vertical_castle
.anchor}*vertical castles,* then the pair of outward cases, the
[]{#royal_castle .anchor}*royal castles*.

### Vertical Castling

When the king castles by making a vertical linear move, it is in both
vertical planes, but legal if *either* plane is unblocked. If he moves
up two tiles, it's a king-side castle[]{.indexref
entry="king-side castle:Castling on the king side."}, if he moves down
two tiles it is a queen-side castle[]{.indexref
entry="queen-side castle:Castling on the queen side."}. In both planes
there is a 3x5 advancement rectangle with one quadrant off the board.
The rook may make either a linear move to a 1,1 tile (in either plane)
or a quadrant move in just one of the back planes. The size of the
rook's advancement manifold depends on how far he must go to get to the
other side of the king.

Because the advancement manifolds of the king and rook overlap, it can
be confusing to see what is going on. It is useful, therefore, to first
present just the king's role in castling.

Figure 131 shows the advancement rectangles for the White king making a
king-side castle[]{.indexref
entry="king-side castle:Castling on the king side."} (a) while the Black
king makes a queen-side castle[]{.indexref
entry="queen-side castle:Castling on the queen side."} (b). In both
cases, the king advances in either back plane with a 3x5 advancement
rectangle. For clarity the full advancement rectangles are shown.

New decorators are in play here. Basically, they are hollow. This
indicates that another piece can block the move, but the king cannot
move there.

![[]{#_Ref75416608 .anchor}Figure 131: Castling Vertically, King
Advancement Rectangles Only](media/image132.png){width="6.7in"
height="6.8in"}

Two examples of the king advancement rectangles for vertical castles;
White king side (a) and Black queen side (b). The White king advances to
KN1,1 on the king side, the Black king to QB1,1 on the queen side. In
both cases there are two advancement rectangles each with one quadrant
off the board: both quadrants shown for clarity. If blocked in one
plane, there would be only one advancement rectangle. Note the
introduction of new decorators. The 'hollowness' indicates that other
pieces there will block the castle, but in no case can the king move to
such tiles.

### King Side Castling

Now for the role of the rook in castling. For a king-side
castle[]{.indexref entry="king-side castle:Castling on the king side."},
the king rook simultaneously advances to perimeter 2 of an advancement
manifold that gets him to an adjacent tile on the other side of the
king; in this case to the king bishop level. If the rook advances to the
KB1,1 tile, it's a linear move; if to either KB1,2 or KB2,1 it's a
quadrant move. All three are adjacent tiles to the king at KN1,1.

Figure 132 shows two examples of king-side castles. White makes a
*linear* king-side castle[]{.indexref
entry="king-side castle:Castling on the king side."} where the rook
advances to KB1,1 in *either* vertical back plane (a). The full rook
advancement rectangles are shown for clarity, even though they extend
off the board. Black makes a *quadrant* king-side castle[]{.indexref
entry="king-side castle:Castling on the king side."}, but in this case
the rook is advancing to either KB1,2 or KB2,1, and so is in just *one*
vertical back plane; a single advancement square for each move (b). In
both cases, of course, the king made a linear move.

There is an ambiguity associated with the rook's move when the king is
blocked in one plane; is the rook free to move in *either* plane, or
must it move in the *same* plane the king did? Since the king and rook
advancement squares don't perfectly overlap, it is possible for the rook
to be blocked in one plane while the king is blocked in the other. If
the latter rule is correct, castling would be illegal in such
circumstances.

There does not appear to be a compelling discovery reason for either
choice. While the invariant that moves in planes should be independent
of each clearly applies, it is ambiguous whether it applies to each
piece individually, or corporately. There is even an argument that the
rook should move in the plane the king does not as this 'reduces' the
supernatural nature of the move.

In such situations, the preference is to opt for the more permissive
rule as this allows players to agree to play to a more restrictive
standard without interference from software. This seems particularly
apropos in this case given that casting is fundamentally a balance rule
in the first place.

Congruent Rule: **Rooks move independently from kings in castling.**

The sidekick rule[]{.indexref
entry="sidekick rule:King advances to perimeter 2, rook advances to adjacent tile, far level."}
is still in play, thus the rook's relative independence from the king is
already muted.[^43] If they do move in different planes, the advancement
squares overlap a lot less making representation on the chess board more
palatable. Sigh.

![[]{#_Ref75443092 .anchor}Figure 132: Castling King Side, Rook
Advancement Manifolds
Only](media/image133.png){alt="A set of musical notes Description automatically generated with low confidence"
width="6.5in" height="6.402777777777778in"}

The rook advances *just far enough* to reach the level on the other side
of the king. Shown are just the rook advancement manifolds for king-side
castles; a linear castle by White to KB1,1 (a) and the two quadrant
castles by Black to either KB1,2 or KB2,1 (b). In all cases, the rook
ends up on the other side of the king (bishop level) on a tile adjacent
to the king where the king can protect it. As before, hollow decorators
indicate tiles which can block the castle but to which the rook cannot
move. This is a partial companion figure to the previous one. Ghost
pieces indicate the legal moves.

### Queen Side Castling

Now for the role of the rook in queen-side castling. For a queen-side
castle[]{.indexref
entry="queen-side castle:Castling on the queen side."}, the queen rook
simultaneously advances to perimeter 3 (one farther than for king side)
of an advancement manifold that gets him to an adjacent tile on the
other side of the king; in this case to the queen level. If the rook
advances to the Q1,1 tile, it's a linear move; if to either Q1,2 or Q2,1
it's a quadrant move. All three are adjacent tiles to the king at QB1,1.

Figure 133 shows two examples of queen-side castles. White makes a
*linear* queen-side castle[]{.indexref
entry="queen-side castle:Castling on the queen side."} where the rook
advances to Q1,1 in *either* vertical back plane (a). The full rook
advancement rectangles are shown for clarity, even though they extend
off the board. Black makes a *quadrant* queen-side castle[]{.indexref
entry="queen-side castle:Castling on the queen side."}, but in this case
the rook is advancing to either Q1,2 or Q2,1, and so is in just *one*
vertical back plane; a single advancement square for each move (b). In
both cases, of course, the king made a linear move.

Note that the advancement manifolds are one perimeter larger in 3D
queen-side castling, just as they are one tile longer in 2D queen-side
castling.

As in 2D, 3 pieces must get out of the way in queen-side castling;
queen, bishop & knight.

![[]{#_Ref75423377 .anchor}Figure 133: Castling Queen Side, Rook
Advancement Manifolds
Only](media/image134.png){alt="A picture containing background pattern Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="6.309027777777778in"}

The rook advances *just far enough* to reach the level on the other side
of the king. Shown are just the rook advancement manifolds for
queen-side castles; a linear castle by White to Q1,1 (a) and the two
quadrant castles by Black to either Q1,2 or Q2,1 (b). In all cases, the
rook ends up on the other side of the king (queen level) on a tile
adjacent to the king where the king can protect it. Note that queen side
castling requires a 4x4 (or 4x7) advancement manifold for the rook in
contrast to a 3x3 (3x5) for a king side castle, one more, just as in 2D.
As before, hollow decorators indicate tiles which can block the castle
but to which the rook cannot move. This is a partial companion figure to
Figure 131. Ghost pieces indicate the legal moves.

Queen side castling offers just as many options for developing the rook,
but as in 2D, the king cannot protect the queen rook pawn.

### Royal Castling[]{.indexref entry="Double Castling:Castling simultaneously on both king and queen sides."}

As noted previously, the king has two linear moves in each back plane
(four in total). Two were simultaneously in both vertical planes, the
other two are simultaneously in both the horizontal plane but in one or
the other vertical plane. Since the horizontal plane is not an
advancement manifold the king has in common with either rook, the
advance is only in the vertical plane.

Call the tiles two steps away which are on the king level but also in
one of the vertical back planes a []{#royal_tile .anchor}*royal
tile*[]{.indexref
entry="royal tile:The end tile on the same level as the king."}, and
when the king advances to it, call that a []{#royal_move .anchor}*royal
move*[]{.indexref entry="royal move:Moving to a royal tile."}. The royal
move[]{.indexref entry="royal move:Moving to a royal tile."} is a linear
move in the intersection of the horizontal and vertical planes. Since
castling is not allowed in a plane that doesn't contain all the tiles of
the home line, the royal move[]{.indexref
entry="royal move:Moving to a royal tile."} occurs only in a vertical
plane. A linear move requires an advancement rectangle consisting of two
adjacent quadrants; in this case, one quadrant is king side, the other
queen side. These two quadrants are precisely the same two quadrants
used in what we can now identify as []{#one_sided_castling
.anchor}*one-sided castling*[]{.indexref
entry="one-sided castling:Either king side or queen side, but not both."};
king side or queen side.

Therefore, a player may have the option, if the rest of the restrictions
on castling are met, to castle *either* king side *or* queen side
*without* the king leaving its home level. Call this a *royal
castle*[]{.indexref
entry="royal castle:King advances to the royal tile, an end tile on the same level."}.

Figure 134 shows Black making a royal castle in either back plane; only
the king advancement rectangles are shown (b), and White making a royal
castle in either back plane; only the rook advancement squares are shown
(a). Obviously, the castles of each player are not coupled, but the
overlapping nature of the advancement manifolds in castling makes a
presentation of castling on static media, even with the colored
decorators, rather confusing.

![[]{#_Ref75426860 .anchor}Figure 134: Castling Royal King
Side](media/image135.png){alt="A screenshot of a video game Description automatically generated with medium confidence"
width="6.5in" height="6.402777777777778in"}

Since for castling, the king and rook advancement manifolds overlap,
this figure shows the king advancement rectangles for royal castling for
Black (b) and the rook advancement squares for royal castling for White
(a) for the case of king-side royal castling. There are three tiles
adjacent to the king in each plane for the rooks, all on the queen
level. As usual, hollow decorators show tiles which the king and rook
cannot move to, but which if occupied will block the castle. For the
royal castles, there is no plane ambiguity, the king and rook of
necessity advance in the same plane. Note that while a linear move for
the king, a royal move occurs only in a vertical plane (and both
quadrants are on the board); there is no advance in the horizontal
plane. As usual, ghost pieces indicate the legal moves.

Figure 135 shows two examples of royal queen side castles, one for White
and one for Black, but where castling in one back plane is blocked. For
both players, royal queen side castling is blocked in the left back
plane but open in the right back plane: White (a) and Black (b).

Queen side castling is blocked for Black in the left back plane by his
black bishop on QR1,6, and for White in her left back plane by her gold
duke on QN1,5. In both cases, it is the rook move which is blocked, the
kings are clear. For clarity, only the decorators for the rook
advancement squares are shown; see previous figure for the king's
advancement rectangles (they are the same for royal castles to either
king side or queen side).

The Intrepid Reader may wish to confirm that neither king is in check,
moving out of check, or through check.

Recall the rejected far side rule[]{.indexref
entry="far side rule:King moves 2 levels, rook advances to level on other side."}
for castling. One of the major reasons for rejecting it was that it
shifted castling from a defensive move towards an offensive move. For
royal castles, the shift is even more dramatic, for now the rook can
extend even further towards the opponent; one more tile for king side
and *two* more for queen side. In the latter case, if the rook comes
under attack, the king cannot get close enough on the next move to
defend it, it takes two moves; doesn't feel like chess.

![A screenshot of a video game Description automatically generated with

[]{#_Ref75432956 .anchor}Figure 135: Castling Royal Queen Side

Two examples of royal queen side castles, one for White (a) and one for
Black (b), both in their respective right back planes. Both are blocked
in their respective left back planes; White by her gold duke on QN1,5
and Black by his white bishop on QR1,6. There are three tiles adjacent
to the king in the right back plane for the rooks, all on the queen
level. As usual, hollow decorators show tiles which the rook cannot move
to, but which if occupied will block the castle. For the royal castles,
there is no plane ambiguity, the king and rook of necessity advance in
the same plane. Note that while a linear move for the king, a royal move
occurs only in a vertical plane (and both quadrants are on the board);
there is no advance in the horizontal plane. As usual, ghost pieces
indicate the legal moves.

### Double Castling

A careful examination of the previous figures reveals an unexpected
ambiguity; when the king makes a royal castle, what is his intent; king
side or queen side? When the king advances to a royal tile[]{.indexref
entry="royal tile:The end tile on the same level as the king."}, it is
*ambiguous* on which *side* castling is occurring. If both are otherwise
legal, *both* rooks may participate in the castling, *simultaneously*.

Call this []{#double_castling .anchor}*double castling*[]{.indexref
entry="double castling:Castling simultaneously on both king and queen sides."}.

This was a surprise. An unexpected side-effect of a strict adherence to
the discovery principle is that in some obscure, hard to explain,
surreal manner, the game itself is teaching us its rules.[^44]

Figure 136 shows an example of a double castle; just for White, just in
the right vertical back plane. Note that the king and queen rooks have
changed *sides*; the king rook ends up on the queen side of the king,
and the queen rook ends up on the king side of the king. For both rooks
there are 3 adjacent tiles, for 9 permutations in each plane, for a
total of 18. That is as many permutations as for all the other castles
combined.

The king rook moves in a 5x5 advancement square, the queen rook in a
6x6, which partially overlap. The rooks have passed through each other -
castling is a supernatural move.

This is an aggressive move as the king has not sought shelter behind a
row of pawns, however, it is *flanked* on both sides by rooks, which
have been developed in a *single* move. It exchanges safety for
initiative developing both rooks at once. It offers a unique risk/reward
tradeoff. In 2D castling, *two* pieces *must* move at once; in 3D
castling, *three* pieces *may* move at once. Move order is fictitious,
even double castling[]{.indexref
entry="double castling:Castling simultaneously on both king and queen sides."}
is atomic.

This admittedly pushes such castles toward being an offensive move in
addition to being a defensive move. However, this is a strong defensive
position, where all three pieces are mutually covering each other.
Furthermore, 64 tiles must be open for this move to not be blocked, both
rooks cannot have been previously moved, the king cannot have moved, and
all the intervening pieces must have gotten out of the way. Double
castles are going to be rare -- rare, but memorable.

If castling in 2D requires *two* pieces to move at once, then perhaps it
should not be surprising that castling in 3D allows *three* pieces to
move at once; it's just par for the course.

This would be a first, a chess move that moves *three* pieces at once.
But this anomaly is not an ad hoc invention bolted on to the game. It
follows naturally from allowing the pieces to express their 3D nature,
planar moves with advancement squares.

If the king has not moved, if neither rook has moved, if all pieces are
out of the way, and the king is not castling out of check, into check or
through check, then when a king advances to a royal tile, it is
ambiguous whether a king-side or a queen-side castle[]{.indexref
entry="queen-side castle:Castling on the queen side."} is intended.
Therefore, *both* rooks may participate in the castle *simultaneously*.
Both the king and queen rooks assume their sidekick positions on either
side of the king, each in one tile from a pair of 3 adjacent tiles, but
they have *changed sides*. Ghost pieces indicate the legal moves. This
is an aggressive move that does not hide the king behind a row of pawns,
it exchanges safety for initiative developing both rooks at once. But
they also flank the king so instead of being guarded by pawns it is now
guarded by rooks.

### 2D Projection

For king-side and queen-side castling, the projection of 3D castling
down to 2D castling is perfect. When the king makes a royal castle, the
projection maintains the relative position of king and rook but is
offset by two levels respectively. There is no analog in 2D chess for
double castling[]{.indexref
entry="double castling:Castling simultaneously on both king and queen sides."}.

### Permutations

It is instructive to compute the number of possible castling moves for
the sidekick rule[]{.indexref
entry="sidekick rule:King advances to perimeter 2, rook advances to adjacent tile, far level."}.
For both king side and queen side castling, the rook has 1 linear move,
plus the 2 royal moves. For each of them the rook has 3 adjacent tiles.
In double castling[]{.indexref
entry="double castling:Castling simultaneously on both king and queen sides."},
the king has just two choices (which plane, ala, which royal
tile[]{.indexref
entry="royal tile:The end tile on the same level as the king."}) and
each rook has 3 adjacent tiles. Thus...

+------------------------------------------------+
| King side permutations; 1 \* 3 = 3.            |
|                                                |
| Queen side permutations; (1 + 3\*2 + 1\*2) \*  |
| 3 = 3.                                         |
|                                                |
| Royal king; 2 \* 3 = 6                         |
|                                                |
| Royal queen; 2 \* 3 = 6                        |
|                                                |
| Double castling; 2 \* (3\*3) = 18.             |
|                                                |
| Total = 9 + 9 + 18 = 36.                       |
+================================================+

That is a bit more than an order of magnitude larger than for 2D (at
just 2), but the board itself is nearly an order of magnitude larger, so
this is reasonably congruent.

At first glance there is a lot here, but it's all just variations on a
theme. The king advances to a linear tile on *perimeter 2* in a back
plane, and the rook advances to an *adjacent tile* on the other side of
the king. That's it.

### Discussion

The sidekick rule[]{.indexref
entry="sidekick rule:King advances to perimeter 2, rook advances to adjacent tile, far level."}
generally forces the king and rook to move in the same plane (*plane
independence*), preserves the *adjacent tile* invariant, preserves the
*far side* invariant, preserves the relative *2D projection*, keeps its
emphasis on *defense* yet with good piece *development*, has far *fewer*
permutations, *and* still allows the *double castle*. The more
aggressive moves have larger rook advancement squares and are thus more
likely to be blocked. This rule is dimension agnostic[]{.indexref
entry="dimension agnostic:Rules of chess which scale to higher dimensions as invariants."}.
Double castling swaps the king and queen rooks.

Given that castling is a balance rule already, and rather ad hoc, this
is rather remarkable. Perhaps there really is a way to play chess in
three dimensions that *feels like chess*; perhaps our quest for the *one
right rule set*, while audacious is not forlorn.

### Castling Through Check

Regardless of whether the castling is king-side, queen-side, royal, or
double, the king has still skipped over one tile. If this tile was under
attack, the king is guilty of trying to castle through check and the
castle is illegal.

Figure 137 shows an example of Black's white bishop preventing a king
side castle because it would require the king to advance through check.

![[]{#_Ref63701153 .anchor}Figure 137: Castling through Check not
Allowed](media/image138.png){alt="Diagram Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="6.309027777777778in"}

A king may not castle out of check, into check, or, as in this example,
through check. Black's white bishop is threatening White's KB1,1 tile,
through which White's king would have to make his linear advance (in
either back plane). In this case, the blurry ghost piece indicates the
problem, this is not a legal move. White is prevented from castling
because the intermediate tile is under attack; just like in 2D. Her
right plane royal castle is blocked for the same reason. The bishop's
5x5 advancement square sits on top of the king's two 3x5 advancement
rectangles for clarity.

### Capture Forbidden

Capture during castling in 2D is prohibited. It should, therefore, also
be prohibited in 3D.

This is a bit of a shame. Perhaps sometime in the future a good case
will be made to add a balance rule that would permit capture during
castling. Fictitiously, the capturing piece could be regarded as having
moved 'first' lest a yet uncaptured piece block the other move. One
could use the atomic rule to get around this, which would also be
essential for that rare case where *both* the king and the rook had
capture options.[^45]

### Congruent Rules

It requires several congruent rules to capture castling.

[]{#_Toc210218278 .anchor}Congruent Rule : **Castling allowed when
neither king nor rook have moved, and when the king does not move out of
check, into check, or through check.**

[]{#_Toc210218279 .anchor}Congruent Rule : **Castling is a supernatural,
atomic event, where both king and rook(s) move simultaneously, typically
in the same manifold.**

[]{#_Toc210218280 .anchor}Congruent Rule : **Castling may occur in any
or all orthogonal manifolds containing the home line**[]{.indexref
entry="home line:Orthogonal line of the opponentâs starting line-up of the major pieces."}**.**

[]{#_Toc210218281 .anchor}Congruent Rule : **The king castles via a
linear rook move to perimeter 2.**

[]{#_Toc210218282 .anchor}Congruent Rule : **The rook castles to
adjacent tiles on the level on the far side of the king.**

[]{#_Toc210218283 .anchor}Congruent Rule : **Ambiguous castling is
inclusive; either or both may be chosen.**

[]{#_Toc210218284 .anchor}Congruent Rule : **Capture during castling is
forbidden.**

### Review

Castling is a balance rule justified by the strategic imperatives of
king safety and piece development. From the perspective of simple
primitives, it is supernatural. As a balance rule it comes with many
restrictions. Discovering the right expression of this rule in 3D
required testing multiple alternatives.

Bishop and duke castling were rejected a priori, *inline
castling*[]{.indexref
entry="inline castling:Castling limited to the home column without advancement squares."}
without advancement manifolds was rejected, as was *linear
castling*[]{.indexref
entry="linear castling:Planar castling limited to the home column only."}
where *only* the vertical linear move was allowed. []{#Far_side_castling
.anchor}*Far side castling*[]{.indexref
entry="Far side castling:Castling obeying the far side rule."} was
rejected because it wasn't defensive enough (a close second, however).

The best rule was []{#sidekick_castling .anchor}*sidekick
castling*[]{.indexref
entry="sidekick castling:Castling obeying the sidekick rule."}; it
honored the intent and restrictions of 2D castling while allowing the
king to express its 3D nature yet keep the rook by its side. It was
dimension agnostic[]{.indexref
entry="dimension agnostic:Rules of chess which scale to higher dimensions as invariants."},
preserved the defensive intent of castling but allowed for good piece
development, permitted an unambiguous definition of 'move through
check,' and projected to 2D with the least divergence. It is
visualizable, with a reasonable increase in permutations, and as a bonus
allowed something new, *double castling*[]{.indexref
entry="double castling:Castling simultaneously on both king and queen sides."}.
It is permissive enough that players could choose more restrictive
options without interference from a software implementation.

It's the rule that best met the criteria, *feels like chess*.

From a critic's perspective, all of the rejected rules have something to
recommend them, particularly the far side rule, but far side castling
was too restrictive to allow double castling[]{.indexref
entry="double castling:Castling simultaneously on both king and queen sides."}.

Double castling is an example of a high strategic principle in chess,
trading risk for initiative; and once the commitment is made to
discovery, to let the pieces express their full 3D nature, double
castling[]{.indexref
entry="double castling:Castling simultaneously on both sides."} shows up
naturally, inevitably, and would have required an ad hoc rule to deny.

Jargon to remember; the *sidekick rule*[]{.indexref
entry="sidekick rule:King advances to perimeter 2, rook advances to adjacent tile, far level."},
king-side castle[]{.indexref
entry="king-side castle:Castling on the king side."}, queen-side
castle[]{.indexref
entry="queen-side castle:Castling on the queen side."}, *royal castle*
(king and queen), *double castling*[]{.indexref
entry="double castling:Castling simultaneously on both king and queen sides."}.

# Part III -- Piece to Piece Interactions

The commitment to honor the *one dimension less* invariant felled the
trajectory paradigm. With it no longer constraining solutions to
straight lines, it became straight forward to discover[]{.indexref
entry="discover:A piece which when moved unblocks an attack from another piece."}
the rules to 3D chess. Once the need for planar moves and advancement
squares was recognized, the rules for how the individual pieces *should*
move appeared naturally, almost inevitably.

Up to this point, the Intrepid Reader has made a substantial
intellectual investment. For those of you still with me, I'm honored.
Here, in Part III, we develop your ROI on that investment. The way
pieces interact with each other in three dimensions, with planar moves
and advancement squares, contain delightful nuances, surprises, and
tactical opportunities far beyond what 2D chess, or any other
multi-dimensional game can hope to offer.

Recharge your thinking cap...

We now turn our attention to the immediate consequences of the rules,
piece to piece interactions. Such a drastic shift in the invariants
honored has far reaching consequences on play. Our quest for the one
right rule set, one that leads to play that feels like chess, is not yet
complete. Now we must embark on a new discovery mission; do the
*consequences* of those rules truly express 'chess-ness?'

We begin with symmetry, symmetries in time, symmetries of space,
symmetries within relationships. The symmetries in 3D are similar but
not identical to those in 2D. While mostly the same, there exist
unexpected edge cases, some break a symmetry, others enable a broken
symmetry, a few complete a symmetry. Together they give the game a more
polished aesthetic.

As a result, a pair of 3D pieces, whether of the same type or of
different types, have a richer, more complete set of ways in which to
interact. Is this still chess? Is it less, more, or just different? Or
is it the case that 2D chess unavoidably shortchanged the game, that 3D
chess is in some sense a more complete construct?

Piece to piece interactions are the fundamental building blocks of
tactics and strategy, which are the focus of Part IV. So, this is
homework, but it's interesting homework.

## Symmetry

Complex systems built upon simple primitives will have symmetries. Rays
are simple primitives, unidirectional vectors that come in pairs, one
forward, one backwards. This produces symmetry in time and symmetry in
space. These symmetries are so natural they go largely unnoticed and
become some of the hidden assumptions that frame our constraining
paradigms.

Figure 138 shows a 2D board with a rook and a bishop, where the tiles of
their moves are marked. Which moves you ask? The next one, or the
previous one?

![[]{#_Ref72933584 .anchor}Figure 138: Symmetry; 2D Base
Pieces](media/image139.png){alt="A picture containing roulette, clipart Description automatically generated"
width="6.43in" height="1.37in"}

The set of all tiles a base piece can potentially reach on the *next*
move is identical to the set of tiles it had to come from on the *prior*
move. Call these []{#symmetry_sets .anchor}*symmetry sets*[]{.indexref
entry="symmetry sets:A set of tiles which indicate both potential next and previous prior tiles."}.
The symmetry set for the rook is marked with red decorators and the
symmetry set for the bishop is marked with green decorators. The bishop
decorator on the overlaid tile of rook and bishop has been raised for
clarity.

This symmetry extends to most of the pieces built up from the base
pieces too, the queen and knight of course, even the king. Only the pawn
violates these symmetries; since it has restricted direction, its past
and future do not look the same.

### Time and Space Symmetry

In chess of any dimension, base pieces on empty boards have
[]{#move_symmetry .anchor}*move symmetry*[]{.indexref
entry="move symmetry:Isolated pieces whose next and previous moves form a symmetry set."}.
Move symmetry implies both time and space symmetry. Like the laws of
physics, they have both []{#temporal_symmetry .anchor}*temporal
symmetry*[]{.indexref
entry="temporal symmetry:Base piece symmetry sets imply temporal symmetry."}
and []{#spatial_symmetry .anchor}*spatial symmetry*[]{.indexref
entry="spatial symmetry:Base piece symmetry sets imply spatial symmetry."}*.*
Place a lone base piece in the center of an empty board and mark out all
the tiles it can reach in one move, as in the 2D figure above. They will
be precisely the same set of tiles that piece had to be on previously to
reach the current tile in one move. The set of *potential next moves* is
identical to the set of *possible previous moves*. This applies not only
to the whole board but to each individual plane as well.

In 2D, there is also []{#tile_symmetry .anchor}*tile
symmetry*[]{.indexref
entry="tile symmetry:When advance manifolds fully overlay retreat manifolds."};
it is the same set of tiles which must be empty for the move, in either
direction, to be unblocked. Note that under the trajectory fiction, the
tiles are also traversed in reverse order.

Figure 139 shows a 3D board with a rook, a bishop, and a duke. The set
of tiles a piece has the potential to reach on the next move, and the
set of tiles it had to come from on the previous move, are marked (one
plane only); a trivial exercise as the two sets are identical. (The
restriction to one plane is simply to reduce clutter.) The planes chosen
are a horizontal plane for the rook, an upward plane for the bishop, and
a major plane for the duke.

![[]{#_Ref72933594 .anchor}Figure 139: Symmetry; 3D Base Pieces have
Temporal and Spatial
Symmetry](media/image140.png){alt="Shape Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="6.111805555555556in"}

Symmetry sets (one plane only) for rook (horizontal), bishop (forward),
and duke (major). Presentation layer order is rook, bishop & duke,
overlaid decorators have not been raised. The set of all tiles a base
piece can reach on the next move is identical to the set of tiles it had
to come from on the previous move.

### Tile Symmetry

In the previous 2D figure, a base piece that made a move, then
*returned* to its original location, utilized the *exact same set* of
tiles. The forward and backwards set of tiles *perfectly overlay*.

Figure 140 shows the advancement manifolds for three rooks advancing and
retreating. Advance is from solid rook to ghost rook; retreat is from
ghost rook to solid rook. The Black rook makes a vertical *linear*
advance (R - KB3,3) and retreats (R - KR3,3), the White rook on the
queen level makes a quadrant advance to an *apex* tile (R - Q4,4) and
retreats (R - Q2,2); in both cases, the manifolds *perfectly* overlay.
In contrast, the other White rook advances to a *between* tile (R -
QN8,4) and retreats (R - QN5,3); but the advancement squares only
*partially* overlay.

![[]{#_Ref73006826 .anchor}Figure 140: Symmetry; Rook Advancement
Manifolds on Between Tiles are Not
Symmetric](media/image141.png){alt="A picture containing shape Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="6.111805555555556in"}

For the rook, advance and retreat[]{.indexref
entry="retreat:Returning to the original tile after an advance."}
manifolds perfectly overlay for end tiles (a) and apex tiles (b), but
not for between tiles (c). Retreat decorators are dimmed; moves are from
solid rooks to ghost rooks and back.

The situation for the bishop is even less symmetric.

Figure 141 shows the advance and retreat manifolds for two bishops. The
Black bishop makes a linear advance and retreat; but *unlike* the rook
the advancement rectangles only partially overlay. The White bishop
makes an advance to a between tile and retreats; like the rook the
advancement squares only partially overlay. Advance is from solid to
ghost; retreat is from ghost to solid.

![Shape Description automatically generated with low
confidence](media/image142.png){width="6.5in"
height="6.111805555555556in"}

[]{#_Ref73007618 .anchor}Figure 141: Symmetry; Bishop Advancement
Manifolds Partially Overlap; End & Between Tiles

The advancement manifolds for bishop advance and retreat moves only
partially overlay on between tiles (a), but also don't fully overlay for
linear moves (b). It is the only base piece whose linear move does not
have symmetric advancement rectangles. For the White bishop, the advance
tiles have been raised so the retreat tiles (dimmed) are more visible.

Figure 142 shows the advance and retreat manifolds for two bishops. The
Black bishop makes an advance to an *apex* tile in the downward plane
and retreats. The White bishop makes an advance to an *apex* tile in the
rightward plane and retreats. This is the only symmetric move for the
bishop.

![[]{#_Ref73010381 .anchor}Figure 142: Symmetry; Bishop Advancement
Manifolds are Symmetric Only on Apex
Tiles](media/image143.png){alt="A picture containing shape Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="6.111805555555556in"}

The advance and retreat manifolds for the bishop only fully overlap for
moves to apex tiles. Shown are two advances and their retreats. The
retreat decorators are dimmed. The advance decorators are slightly
offset for clarity. Advance is from solid piece to ghost piece;
retreat[]{.indexref
entry="retreat:Returning to the original tile after an advance."} is
from ghost piece to solid piece. The White bishop moves in her rightward
plane (a), Black bishop moves in his downward plane (b).

The duke, surprisingly, has the same symmetry properties as the rook;
symmetric for linear and apex moves (and duplex), but not for advances
to between tiles.

Figure 143 shows one duke advancing to an apex tile (a), an end tile
(b), and a duplex tile (c). It should be clear from inspection that each
retreat[]{.indexref
entry="retreat:Returning to the original tile after an advance."}
advancement manifold will perfectly overlay the forward one.

![[]{#_Ref73045100 .anchor}Figure 143: Symmetry; Duke Linear, Apex &
Duplex Advancement Manifolds Fully
Overlap](media/image144.png){alt="A picture containing shape Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="6.111805555555556in"}

For the duke, advance and retreat moves perfectly overlay for apex tiles
(a), end tiles (b), and duplex tiles (c). Note that one quadrant of a
linear move is an apex quadrant, the other a duplex quadrant. Advance is
from the sole solid piece to the three ghost pieces; retreat is from the
ghost pieces to the sole solid piece. The retreat decorators are not
shown.

Figure 144 shows the advancement manifolds for a duke making an advance
to a between tile (a Feynman tile as luck would have it) and a full
retreat; but the advancement squares only *partially* overlay.

![[]{#_Ref73045109 .anchor}Figure 144: Symmetry; Duke Advancement
Manifolds on Between Tiles are Not
Symmetric](media/image145.png){width="6.5in"
height="6.111805555555556in"}

That advancement squares for duke advance to and retreat[]{.indexref
entry="retreat:Returning to the original tile after an advance."} from
between tiles do not fully overlay. Retreat decorators are dimmed;
advance decorators slightly raised for clarity. Advance is from solid
piece to ghost piece, retreat[]{.indexref
entry="retreat:Returning to the original tile after an advance."} from
ghost piece to solid piece.

### Review

In both 2D and 3D, the set of tiles a base piece can reach on the next
move and the set of tiles a base piece had to come from on the previous
move are, on an empty board, identical. The moves are symmetric in both
time and space.

While the advancement manifolds for advance and retreat[]{.indexref
entry="retreat:Returning to the original tile after an advance."}
between two tiles always overlay each other completely in 2D, whether or
not they fully overlay in 3D depends on the type of move and the type of
piece. For all three base pieces, the overlay is complete for apex
moves, but not for moves to between tiles. For the bishop, the linear
moves do not have advancement manifolds which fully overlay.[^46] While
the 3D *moves* are *temporally and spatially* symmetric, the
corresponding *advancement manifolds* are *not*. They lack tile
symmetry.

This is going to have interesting consequences.

Note that this asymmetry is not an issue for the pawn, it can't
retreat[]{.indexref
entry="retreat:Returning to the original tile after an advance."}, and
it is not an issue for the knight as it jumps and doesn't have an
advancement manifold in either game. The knight has full tile symmetry
in both games.

For the stack there are two situations. When the stack advances to a
*q-tile*, it is an *apex* move for the duke part and a *linear* move for
the bishop part, so it is possible for the stack to advance but *only
the duke can retreat*[]{.indexref
entry="retreat:Returning to the original tile after an advance."}. When
the stack advances to a *Feynman tile*, it is an *apex* move for the
bishop, but a *between* tile for the duke, so it is possible for the
stack to advance but *only the bishop can retreat*[]{.indexref
entry="retreat:Returning to the original tile after an advance."}.

For the king, it is not an issue for rook-like or duke-like moves
either, however its bishop-like retreat has the potential to be blocked
because the apex tiles of the forward and retreat advancement rectangles
do not overlay. Lots of chess puzzle possibilities here.

## Pairwise Engagements

The previous chapter covered the symmetries of individual pieces. There
are also symmetries between pieces. The place to start is simple *pairs*
of pieces. The members of the pair can be of the same type, or of
different type.

### 2D Like Piece Asymmetry

Recall, that the most fundamental degenerate rule in 2D chess is whether
pieces should move in straight lines or in one dimension less than the
board. Both are invariants in two dimensions, but in the generalization
to higher dimensions, both cannot be honored; one must be shunned.

When preference is given to the *straight-line invariant,* then *unlike*
base pieces follow a broken symmetry. A rook may attack a bishop without
counterattack, a bishop may attack a rook without counterattack, or
neither attacks the other, but they cannot *simultaneously* attack each
other. Only *three* of the four logical alternatives are possible.

*Like* pieces also follow a broken symmetry. With straight lines, two
rooks are either attacking each other, or they are not. Two bishops are
either attacking each other, or they are not. There is no way for one
rook to attack another without a counterattack and likewise no way for
one bishop to attack another without a counterattack. Only *two* of the
four logical alternatives are possible.

With planar moves all four alternatives for both like and unlike pieces
are possible -- symmetry restored.

Figure 145 shows the broken symmetries in 2D. Like-on-like (rook versus
rook and bishop versus bishop) and unlike-on-unlike (rook versus
bishop).

![[]{#_Ref72576451 .anchor}Figure 145: Pairwise Broken Symmetry Between
Like and Unlike Base Pieces in
2D](media/image146.png){alt="A picture containing text, clipart Description automatically generated"
width="6.44in" height="1.55in"}

Black's queen side bishop is attacking White' king side rook, but the
rook is not counterattacking. It is, however, attacking Black's king
side bishop, but the bishop is not counterattacking. Neither Black rook
is attacking the White bishops and neither of the White bishops are
attacking the Black rooks. The queen side rooks are attacking each
other. Neither king side rook is attacking the other.

### 3D Unlike Piece Symmetry

When preference is given to the *one-dimension-less invariant* this
symmetry is restored, all four logical possibilities are possible. For
*unlike* pieces, the symmetries of one-way attacks, or no attack at all
are obvious; one piece must be in the plane of the other, or neither.
However, in 3D, it is possible for both to be in each other's planes
simultaneously. They can mutually attack each other; there is no analog
in 2D chess.

Figure 146 shows this restored symmetry for base pieces 1 & 2 connected
by a *brook tile*, a rook and a bishop mutually attacking each other.
Both attacks are to their respective perimeter 3's.

![[]{#_Ref73090085 .anchor}Figure 146: Pairwise Restored Symmetry
Between Rook & Bishop (Brook
Tile)](media/image147.png){alt="Shape Description automatically generated with low confidence"
width="6.5in" height="6.111805555555556in"}

The rook is attacking the bishop via an apex tile on perimeter 3 in
quadrant 1 of the horizontal plane. Simultaneously, the bishop is
counterattacking with a linear move to perimeter 3 in the two outward
planes. They are connected by a *brook tile*. The rook's degree of cover
is 1, the bishop's is 2.

Figure 147 shows this restored symmetry for base pieces 1 & 2 connected
by a *q-tile*, a rook and a bishop mutually attacking each other, and
for base pieces 2 & 3, also connected by a *q-tile*, a bishop and a duke
mutually attacking each other. Note the bishop perimeter is twice the
duke perimeter. The White rook covers the Black bishop in one plane
(horizontal), which counterattacks in two planes (outwards). The White
bishop covers the Black duke in two planes (at perimeter 2), which
counterattacks in one plane (perimeter 1).

![[]{#_Ref73090449 .anchor}Figure 147: Pairwise Restored Symmetry
Between Bishop & Rook and Bishop & Duke
(Q-tile)](media/image148.png){alt="Shape Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="6.111805555555556in"}

White rook and Black bishop in mutual attack on perimeter 2, this time
via *q-tile* (every other brook tile is a q-tile), and the White bishop
and Black duke in a mutual attack (perimeter 2 for the bishop, perimeter
1 for the duke), also by *q-tile*. The bishops' attacks are linear
(cover 2) the rook and duke attacks are apex (cover 1).

Figure 148 shows this restored symmetry for base pieces 1 & 3 connected
by a *q-tile*, a rook and a duke mutually attacking each other. Note the
rook perimeter is twice the duke perimeter. Each piece covers the other
with degree 1. This completes the q-tile attacks.

![[]{#_Ref73091395 .anchor}Figure 148: Pairwise Restored Symmetry
Between Rook & Duke (Q
Tile)](media/image149.png){alt="A picture containing text Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="6.111805555555556in"}

The rook is attacking the duke via an apex tile on perimeter 4 in
quadrant 3 of the horizontal plane. Simultaneously, the duke is
counterattacking via an apex tile on perimeter 2 in quadrant 1 of the
major plane. They are connected by a *q-tile*. Both rook and duke have
one degree of cover over the other.

It is a pleasant coincidence that the queen overlap tiles offer a useful
taxonomy for describing how unlike pieces can simultaneously attack each
other; but upon reflection -- duh.

Figure 149 shows this restored symmetry for base pieces 1 & 3 connected
by a *hotspot tile*, a rook and a duke mutually attacking each other.
The rook covers the duke with 2 attacks via a linear move on perimeter
2, while the duke counterattacks with 2 attacks via a duplex tile, but
on perimeter 1.

Tile)](media/image150.png){alt="A picture containing text Description automatically generated"

The rook is attacking the duke via a linear move to perimeter 2 in the
vertical planes. Simultaneously, the duke is counterattacking via a
duplex tile on perimeter 1 in the major and minor planes. They are
connected by a *hotspot tile*. Both rook and duke have two
degrees[]{.indexref
entry="degrees:The degree of a trapdoor is the number of extra moves to retreat."}
of cover over the other.

Figure 150 shows this restored symmetry for base pieces 2 & 3 connected
by a *Feynman tile*, a bishop and a duke mutually attacking each other.
The bishop covers the duke with 1 attack via an apex move on perimeter
2, while the duke counterattacks (single cover) via a between tile, but
on perimeter 3.

Figure 150: Pairwise Restored Symmetry Between Bishop & Duke (Feynman
Tile)

The bishop is attacking the duke via an apex move to perimeter 2 in the
leftward plane. Simultaneously, the duke is counterattacking via a
between tile on perimeter 3 in the upleft plane. They are connected by a
*Feynman tile*. Both pieces have one degree of cover over the other.

Calling this a restored symmetry is a bit weird, since there is no duke
in 2D; but given that it takes both pieces to capture all the 2D
invariants of the bishop, it's kind of like the bishop attacks itself.

### 3D Like Piece Symmetry

To reiterate, it is not possible in 2D chess for one rook to attack
another without also being under a counterattack, nor is it possible for
one bishop to attack another without also being under a counterattack,
but in 3D chess it is possible because some advance and
retreat[]{.indexref
entry="retreat:Returning to the original tile after an advance."} moves
have advancement manifolds which don't fully overlay each other. The
advance manifold represents the attack, the retreat[]{.indexref
entry="retreat:Returning to the original tile after an advance."}
manifold represents the counterattack.

Call this an []{#overlay_failure .anchor}*overlay failure*[]{.indexref
entry="overlay failure:When advance and retreat manifolds donât fully overlay each other."}.
Call the tiles in both manifolds []{#overlay_tiles .anchor}*overlay
tiles* and any that are in only one advancement manifold
[]{#extant_tiles .anchor}*extant tiles*[]{.indexref
entry="extant tile:A tile outside the overlay portion of advance and retreat manifolds."}.
When a piece attacks another of the same type located on a between tile,
or when the bishop makes a linear attack on another bishop, there will
be extant tiles[]{.indexref
entry="extant tile:A tile outside the overlay portion of advance and retreat manifolds."}.
Any *third piece* placed on any of the extant tiles[]{.indexref
entry="extant tile:A tile outside the overlay portion of advance and retreat manifolds."}
results in a one-way attack.

#### Peeking

A one-way attack between two like pieces is not apparent in the
definition of base pieces, nor planar moves, nor advancement squares; it
requires a third piece. Therefore, the term []{#peeking-1
.anchor}*peeking*[]{.indexref
entry="peeking:A one-way attack because of a third piece on an extant tile."}
will be used. Call this an []{#ancillary_piece .anchor}*ancillary
piece*.

Figure 151 shows a White rook peeking[]{.indexref
entry="peeking:A one-way attack because of a third piece on an extant tile."}
around its own pawn in the horizontal plane attacking a Black rook whose
potential counterattack is blocked by the pawn. From the perspective of
the Black rook, the White rook and pawn are in a mutual blocking
situation.

![[]{#_Ref73097730 .anchor}Figure 151: Pairwise Peeking Between
Rooks](media/image152.png){alt="A picture containing text, checker Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="2.375in"}

The White rook is attacking the Black rook in the horizontal plane, at a
between tile on perimeter 2 (a). There is no counterattack however, as
the reverse advancement square includes the pawn in a mutual blocking
situation with the White rook (b) resulting in a one-way attack. The
White rook is *peeking*[]{.indexref
entry="peeking:A one-way attack because of a third piece on an extant tile."}
out around its own pawn (the ancillary pieces) which is in the *extant
tiles*[]{.indexref
entry="extant tile:A tile outside the overlay portion of advance and retreat manifolds."}
of the Black rook's counterattack advancement square.

#### Trapdoor Move

The flip side of peeking[]{.indexref
entry="peeking:A one-way attack because of a third piece on an extant tile."}
is the []{#trapdoor_move .anchor}*trapdoor move*[]{.indexref
entry="trapdoor move:An advance that cannot fully retreat in one move."};
if the White rook captures the Black one, it cannot return to its
original position in *one move*. If it was defending something critical,
Black may have just sacrificed material to gain the initiative.

Figure 152 shows the trapdoor move for the White rook on KR3,4 peeking
out around its pawn. It captures the Black rook, then must make two
moves to return to KR3,4.

![[]{#_Ref73130345 .anchor}Figure 152: Pairwise Rook Succumbs to
Trapdoor
Move](media/image153.png){alt="A screenshot of a video game Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="5.0in"}

Snapshots of a trapdoor move. The White rook is attacking the Black rook
in a one-way attack by *peeking* around its pawn (a). If it captures the
opposing rook (b), it has executed a *trapdoor move* (c) because it will
take *two* moves to return to its original position (d) for now the very
pawn that it was peeking around, has blocked its direct
*retreat*[]{.indexref
entry="retreat:Returning to the original tile after an advance."}.

The intent to return to the original tile after an advance will be
called a []{#retreat .anchor}*retreat*[]{.indexref
entry="retreat:Returning to the original tile after an advance."}. The
extant tiles of a retreat[]{.indexref
entry="retreat:Returning to the original tile after an advance."} create
the peeking and trapdoor scenarios whenever they are not empty. The
extant tiles will always contain the apex tile but will only contain one
side of the perimeter of the retreat[]{.indexref
entry="retreat:Returning to the original tile after an advance."}'s
advancement square. Visually, they will appear as a row in the plane of
the advancing/retreating piece. When there is *one* row, the
retreat[]{.indexref
entry="retreat:Returning to the original tile after an advance."} faces
a *mutual blocking* situation, when *two or more* rows the
retreat[]{.indexref
entry="retreat:Returning to the original tile after an advance."} faces
a *quadrant blocking* situation.

Trapdoor moves come with []{#degrees .anchor}*degrees*[]{.indexref
entry="degrees:The degree of a trapdoor is the number of extra moves to retreat."}.
If the moving piece is confined to the advancing plane, its attack
plane, then a quadrant blocking situation may require *three* moves to
retreat[]{.indexref
entry="retreat:Returning to the original tile after an advance."} back
to the original location. Ouch. If an intersecting plane is open, it can
still return in two.

Here is an interesting gambit[]{.indexref
entry="gambit:Standard sequence of moves with a well establish purpose or outcome."};
the attack is a peeking attack, the trapdoor in the attack plane is of
degree 2 (3 moves to return), but an intersecting plane will allow
retreat in 2 moves. The capture occurs, with the attacker confident of a
2-move retreat[]{.indexref
entry="retreat:Returning to the original tile after an advance."}, but
the opponent develops a piece such as to block the intersecting plane
increasing the moves to return from 2 to 3. Call this a
[]{#dynamic_trapdoor .anchor}*dynamic trapdoor*[]{.indexref
entry="dynamic trapdoor:Opponentâs move increases the trapdoor degree after the advance."}
move. What a clever way to confine the aggressor.

Note, a trapdoor move of degree zero is not a trapdoor at all and
retreat[]{.indexref
entry="retreat:Returning to the original tile after an advance."} can be
accomplished in 1 move.

An extant tile set of three rows, however, is still a quadrant blocking
situation, so an in-plane retreat[]{.indexref
entry="retreat:Returning to the original tile after an advance."} still
requires three moves, not four; it is not the case that an extra move is
required for each row in the extant tiles, just one more for the change
from mutual to quadrant blocking. However, if there is *more than one
ancillary piece* to peek around things can get more interesting. This is
[]{#nested_peeking .anchor}*nested peeking*[]{.indexref
entry="nested peeking:Peeking around more than one piece resulting in a slower retreat."}
and its inverse is the []{#nested_trapdoor .anchor}*nested
trapdoor*[]{.indexref
entry="nested trapdoor:Larger trapdoor degree because of nested peeking."}
move. When []{#fully_nested .anchor}*fully nested*[]{.indexref
entry="fully nested:Each row in the extant tiles increases the retreat by another move."},
it will in fact require 1 additional move per row in the extant tiles
for an in-plane retreat[]{.indexref
entry="retreat:Returning to the original tile after an advance."}.

The peeking[]{.indexref
entry="peeking:A one-way attack because of a third piece on an extant tile."}
and trapdoor situations for advances to a between tile are exactly
parallel for the bishop and duke, however, they are also possible for
the bishop's linear move.

Figure 153 shows the White bishop peeking around its knight in a one-way
attack on the Black bishop on its perimeter 3. The Black bishop's
counterattack is blocked at perimeter 2 by the knight. This means the
extant tiles (dimmed) encompass two perimeters; note the two rows.

![[]{#_Ref73266471 .anchor}Figure 153: Pairwise Peeking Between Bishops
on Between
Tiles](media/image154.png){alt="Shape Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="6.111805555555556in"}

The 4x4 advancement square of the White bishop's attack on the Black
bishop shows a one-way attack between like pieces because the White
bishop is *peeking* around its knight. The target is on perimeter 3, but
the knight is on perimeter 2 of the retreat[]{.indexref
entry="retreat:Returning to the original tile after an advance."} 3x3
advancement square, so is a *quadrant block* not a *mutual block*, thus
the knight is *exposed*. The extant tiles encompass *two* perimeters, as
evident by the *double row* of dimmed decorators. If the bishop is
confined to the rightward plane, the *trapdoor* retreat[]{.indexref
entry="retreat:Returning to the original tile after an advance."} will
require *three* moves to return to the original location.

Figure 154 shows a Black duke peeking around its own king to create a
one-way attack on the White duke in which it and its king are currently
in a mutual block situation. The extant tiles are only one row wide, so
this is a trapdoor of degree 1: two moves to retreat[]{.indexref
entry="retreat:Returning to the original tile after an advance."}.

![[]{#_Ref73272063 .anchor}Figure 154: Pairwise Peeking Between
Dukes](media/image155.png){alt="A picture containing diagram Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="6.111805555555556in"}

The Black duke is attacking the White duke on perimeter 2 in its major
plane by peeking out around its own king. The single row of extant tiles
is shown dimmed, which means this is a trapdoor move of degree 1.

When it comes to peeking and trapdoor moves to *between* tiles, the
rook, bishop, and duke are all very similar.

However, things are more nuanced when the bishop peeks via a linear
move, because now *two* planes are involved. If the attack was unblocked
in both planes, it will take a *third* and a *fourth* ancillary piece to
prevent the counterattack; one in the set of extant tiles[]{.indexref
entry="extant tile:A tile outside the overlay portion of advance and retreat manifolds."}
of each plane.

One of the planes can be taken out of the equation for both bishops if a
third piece is placed on an overlay tile, or a third and fourth piece
are placed on both sets of extant tiles in the same plane[]{.indexref
entry="overlay tile:A tile which is in both the advance and retreat advancement manifolds."}.
Either situation blocks both bishops from moving in that plane. Then a
fourth (or fifth) piece placed on an extant tile in the other plane will
produce a one-way attack; one bishop will peek out around that final
piece. This effectively reduces the linear attack to having the same
positional semantics as those of between tile peeking situations.

The most bizarre case is when the third and fourth ancillary pieces are
in different sets of extant tiles, one piece in one plane, one piece in
the other. Now each bishop is attacking the other but in different
planes.

Whichever piece moves first can capture the other and it can
subsequently retreat[]{.indexref
entry="retreat:Returning to the original tile after an advance."} to its
original position in just one move; neither a peeking[]{.indexref
entry="peeking:A one-way attack because of a third piece on an extant tile."}
nor a trapdoor situation. However, it advanced in *one plane* and
retreated in the *other*. Call this a []{#revolving_door
.anchor}*revolving door*[]{.indexref
entry="revolving door:A linear advance in one plane followed by a retreat in the other."}
move; entered on the right side, exited on the left.

Like 2D chess, 3D chess can be analyzed to deeper and deeper levels,
there is an almost inexhaustible sequence of nuances to confuse,
confound, and finally delight the passionate aficionado.

### Review

In 2D chess, the symmetry between like and unlike pieces is broken; like
pieces are either both attacking each other, or neither is, and unlike
pieces are never each attacking the other simultaneously. Of the four
logical possibilities, like pieces achieve only two, and unlike pieces
achieve only three.

In 3D chess, unlike pieces can each simultaneously attack the other,
because their planes intersect in lines. The queen's overlap tiles do
double duty helping to clarify when two unlike pieces are
counterattacking. Like pieces can, with the help of an *ancillary*
piece, have one-way attacks on each other. Thus, in 3D chess, all four
logical possibilities become possible; symmetry restored.

One-way attacks are possible because the *advance* and *retreat*
advancement manifolds may not fully *overlay* each other. The tiles that
are not common to both are called *extant* tiles. Ancillary pieces in
the extant tiles allow for *peeking* and t*rapdoor moves*. Trapdoor
moves come with *degrees*, which can be *dynamic*, and can be *nested*,
further increasing the number of moves required to *fully* retreat to
the original location.

The bishop's linear moves exhibits yet another novelty, the *revolving
door*, where attack is in one plane, but retreat is in the other.

## Blocks, Pins & Discovered Attacks

The logical progression we are following is quite simply one, two,
three, many. We covered what the move of a *single* piece looks like,
and what the symmetries of a *pair* of interacting pieces look like, and
how an ancillary piece affects those symmetries. In this chapter, we
consider the patterns which encapsulate how *three or more primary*
pieces interact.

### One Dimension Less

3D chess with planar moves differs from 2D chess in ways that transcend
mere differences in dimension.

In 2D, the lines of straight-line moves intersect at a *single* tile,
the location of the piece. In 3D, in contrast, planar moves intersect
each other in straight lines along a *linear set* of tiles, and it is
only the intersection of those straight lines that intersect at a single
tile, the location of the piece. Any []{#intersection_tile
.anchor}*intersection tile*[]{.indexref
entry="intersection tile:Tiles in multiple advancement manifolds."} is
therefore under attack in at least two planes.

This immediately violates an invariant of 2D chess; a covered piece is
covered in only one way. If another piece blocks that cover, it fully
blocks; it never takes more than one piece to block[]{.indexref
entry="block:Blocks cover, prevents a piece from moving to a desired location."}
a cover. In 3D chess, it is possible for just one piece to entirely
block[]{.indexref
entry="block:Blocks cover, prevents a piece from moving to a desired location."}
the cover, but it is likely that it will take more. For the duke and the
composite pieces, this might require three or even four pieces, each
additional piece steadily eroding the []{#degree_of_cover
.anchor}*degree of cover*[]{.indexref
entry="degree of cover:How many ways a piece covers a tile (0 to 4)."}.

### Cover[]{.indexref entry="Cover:A tile a piece can reach, or a foe it can attack, or a friend it can defend."}

[]{#cover-1 .anchor}Cover[]{.indexref
entry="Cover:A tile a piece can reach, or a foe it can attack, or a friend it can defend."}
is the generic term for one piece attacking a foe or defending a friend.
It will often be used to refer to the tiles some piece can reach in one
move; it *covers* them. For a tile to be covered, it must lie in the
type of plane that piece can move in. For the limited range pieces (pawn
and king), it must also lie within reach. And in all cases, obviously,
it must be unblocked.

If a piece is attacking a foe piece, another piece can []{#block
.anchor}*block*[]{.indexref
entry="block:Blocks cover, prevents a piece from moving to a desired location."}
this cover by getting in the way; in 3D chess this means blocking the
advancement manifold. If a piece blocks an attack on another of the same
player, it is []{#pinned .anchor}*pinned*[]{.indexref
entry="pinned:A piece which if moved unblocks an attack on a higher value piece."}
(particularly if the other piece is of higher value) for if it moves it
no longer blocks the attack, exposing the other piece. If that other
piece is the king, it cannot even legally move (can't move into check).
If a friend piece blocks an attack on a foe, then if the friend moves it
[]{#discovers .anchor}*discovers* an attack on the foe.

### Blocks, Pins & Discovers in 2D

Blocks pins & discovered attacks all require 3 pieces, an attacker, a
target, and a blocker. They are fundamental to tactics in chess.

First a quick review of blocking, pinning and discovered attacks in 2D.
The rook (as usual) will serve as the point of our discovery spear.

Figure 155 shows a White rook hoping to threaten three major pieces of
Black. The attack on the king is blocked by the bishop, the attack on
the queen is blocked by the knight, and the attack on the rook is
blocked by White's own pawn.

However, this also means the bishop is pinned[]{.indexref
entry="pinned:A piece which if moved unblocks an attack on a higher value piece."}
against the king, it cannot move because it would expose the king to
check. The knight is also pinned[]{.indexref
entry="pinned:A piece which if moved unblocks an attack on a higher value piece."}
against the queen, though less severely. Technically it can move, but it
is unlikely to be wise since it self-discovers an attack on the queen
and the queen is a more valuable piece than the knight. White's pawn is
not pinned as it is a friend piece[]{.indexref
entry="pinned:A piece which if moved unblocks an attack on a higher value piece."}.
Nonetheless, if it does in fact move, it discovers an attack on the
rook.

![[]{#_Ref72493923 .anchor}Figure 155: Blocks, Pins & Discovers in
2D](media/image156.png){alt="A picture containing clipart Description automatically generated"
width="6.45in" height="1.5in"}

Decorators indicate the paths of the rook's attack. Extended they would
attack king, queen, & rook, but are blocked by bishop, knight, & pawn
respectively, which are shown with red []{#halos .anchor}*halos*. The
bishop is pinned[]{.indexref
entry="pinned:A piece which if moved unblocks an attack on a higher value piece."}
to the king, the knight pinned[]{.indexref
entry="pinned:A piece which if moved unblocks an attack on a higher value piece."}
to the queen, and if the White pawn moves it discovers an attack on the
Black rook.

Cover[]{.indexref
entry="Cover:A tile a piece can reach, or a foe it can attack, or a friend it can defend."},
blocks, pins, and discovered attacks are some of the fundamental
concepts that chess tactics are based on. They play the same role in 3D,
and in many ways are very much the same, but the advancement square
introduces several new nuances.

### Blocking in 3D

In 2D, tiles are added *one at-a-time* to the advancement
manifold[]{.indexref
entry="advancement manifold:Regular region of tiles which must be empty to permit move."},
but because of the increase in the dimensionality of planar moves, tiles
are added *a perimeter at-a-time* in 3D chess. This difference affects
cover and blocking in subtle ways. In 3D, there are five
[]{#blocking_types .anchor}*blocking types*[]{.indexref
entry="blocking types:Five blocking types, they determine blocking behavior."};
in 2D only one.

Figure 156 shows a single, but very threatening rook. The White rook
would like to threaten the Black king, queen, black bishop (behind the
white one), rook, and the knights, but he is blocked. Each target,
however, is blocked in a *different* way. The next few figures are going
to decompose this position.

![[]{#_Ref72501782 .anchor}Figure 156: BPD; Types of
Blocking](media/image157.png){alt="Background pattern Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="6.111805555555556in"}

Shows the White rook imposing all five types of blocking on Black. In
*linear blocking*[]{.indexref
entry="linear blocking:One in-line piece can block attack in all planes."}
one piece can block (a), in *planar blocking*[]{.indexref
entry="planar blocking:Two or more pieces required to block, one in each plane."}
it takes two or more (b), in *quadrant blocking*[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant blocking:Piece on the earliest perimeter blocks the rest of the quadrant."}
the piece on the earliest perimeter blocks (c), in *quiet
blocking*[]{.indexref
entry="quiet blocking:Earlier piece on the far side of the advancement manifold blocks."}
one piece is on the far side of the advancement manifold (d), and in
*mutual blocking*[]{.indexref
entry="mutual blocking:Two or more pieces on the same perimeter block attack on each other."}
two or more pieces are on the same perimeter (e).

That's a lot to take in, so let's consider them one at-a-time.

Figure 157 shows the rook's intended attack on the king is blocked by
the pawn. The pawn is *in-line* between the rook and king, and thus is
blocking the attack in *both* vertical planes. This is
[]{#linear_blocking .anchor}*linear blocking*[]{.indexref
entry="linear blocking:One in-line piece can block attack in all planes."};
one piece is sufficient to block the cover. It is most like blocking in
2D.

![[]{#_Ref72501929 .anchor}Figure 157: BPD; Linear
Blocking](media/image158.png){alt="A picture containing text Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="6.111805555555556in"}

The rook's intended attack on the king is blocked in both vertical
planes by the pawn. The two 2x3 advancement rectangles are shown and the
covered pawn sports a red halo.

Figure 158 shows the rook's intended attack on the queen is blocked by
*two* pieces in *different* planes; the pawn blocks the left vertical
plane, and the duke blocks the horizontal plane. This is
[]{#planar_blocking .anchor}*planar blocking*[]{.indexref
entry="planar blocking:Two or more pieces required to block, one in each plane."};
it requires two or more pieces to fully block the cover. There is no 2D
analog.

![[]{#_Ref72501937 .anchor}Figure 158: BPD; Planar
Blocking](media/image159.png){alt="A screenshot of a video game Description automatically generated with low confidence"
width="6.5in" height="6.111805555555556in"}

The rook's intended attack on the queen is blocked by two pieces, the
pawn on the knight level blocks the attack in the vertical plane (2x3
advancement rectangle) and the duke blocks the attack in the horizontal
plane (3x5 advancement rectangle). Both covered pieces sport red halos.
The linear decorators toward the queen have two inner diamonds, one
solid, one open, to indicate that at this point the rook is advancing in
only one plane, not two.

Figure 159 shows the rook's intended attack on the black bishop is
blocked by the white bishop. The white bishop is on an *earlier*
perimeter in the forward quadrant of the horizontal plane. This is
[]{#quadrant_blocking .anchor}*quadrant blocking*[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant blocking:Piece on the earliest perimeter blocks the rest of the quadrant."}*;*
one piece is sufficient to block cover. It is much like blocking in 2D.

![[]{#_Ref72501947 .anchor}Figure 159: BPD; Quadrant
Blocking](media/image160.png){alt="A screenshot of a video game Description automatically generated with low confidence"
width="6.5in" height="6.111805555555556in"}

The rook's intended attack on the black bishop is blocked by the white
bishop on an earlier perimeter (#3). Technically, the rook cannot get to
any tile on perimeter 3 of his 4x4 advancement square except the one
occupied by the white bishop. The covered bishop sports a red halo.

Looks like there will be a need for decorators that communicate what
tiles *block* and what tiles can *be reached* by an advancing piece;
they are not always the same.

Figure 160 shows the White rook's intended attack on the Black rook is
blocked by the duke far, far away. The duke is technically on an earlier
perimeter, but on the *opposite side* of the advancement square. This is
[]{#quantum_blocking .anchor}*quiet blocking*[]{.indexref
entry="quiet blocking:Earlier piece on the far side of the advancement manifold blocks."},
quiet because it is easy to miss. While formally just a variation on
quadrant blocking[]{.indexref
entry="quadrant blocking:Piece on the earliest perimeter blocks the rest of the quadrant."},
being so far away is jarring. No 2D analog either; in 2D a blocking
piece is always "in the way" -- the trajectory paradigm again.

![[]{#_Ref72501970 .anchor}Figure 160: BPD; Quiet
Blocking](media/image161.png){alt="A picture containing diagram Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="6.111805555555556in"}

The rook's intended attack on the rook (QR level, partially obscured) is
blocked by the duke on the far side of the quadrant. The 5x5 advancement
square is shown; a 6x6 one is required. The covered duke sports a red
halo. Note smaller diamond in end tile decorator when blocked by queen.

Figure 161 shows the rook's intended attack on the knights is blocked
by...the knights. Both knights are on the *same* perimeter in the
downward quadrant of the left vertical plane. This is
[]{#mutual_blocking .anchor}*mutual blocking*[]{.indexref
entry="mutual blocking:Two or more pieces on the same perimeter block attack on each other."};
each piece blocks cover on the other. There is no 2D analog. Note the
use of new decorators on the final perimeter; the rook does not have
access to any tile there.

![[]{#_Ref72501957 .anchor}Figure 161: BPD; Mutual
Blocking](media/image162.png){width="6.5in"
height="6.111805555555556in"}

The rook's intended attack on either knight is blocked by the other
knight as they are on the same perimeter (5x5 advancement square). The
hollow decorators on the last perimeter (#4) indicate that advance can
be blocked there, but that the rook cannot reach them. Note that while
both knights sport red halos, neither is under attack; when there is
more than one halo, the haloed pieces are in a mutual blocking
situation, which also means they are pinned against each other. The new
decorators are for end, apex, and body tiles.

While a bit meticulous at 5 separate figures, trying to make sense of
this situation with all the advancement manifolds on the board at the
same time is rather taxing.

### Pinning in 3D

Pinning is the flip side of blocking when the blocking piece is a foe.
Normally regarded as a pin only when the piece under attack is of less
value than the one behind it.

Figure 162 shows the same situation as in the previous figures, but now
with the emphasis on pins rather than blocks. Advancement manifolds have
been suppressed and all six pinned pieces sport red halos.

![[]{#_Ref72505208 .anchor}Figure 162: BPD s; Types of
Pinning](media/image163.png){alt="A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated with low confidence"
width="6.5in" height="6.111805555555556in"}

The White rook creates all five types of pinning. In *linear pinning*
one piece is pinned (a), in *planar pinning* two or more are pinned (b),
in *quadrant pinning* the piece on the earliest perimeter is pinned (c),
in *quiet pinning* the pinned piece is on the far side of the
advancement manifold (d), and in *mutual pinning* two or more pieces are
on the same perimeter and pin each other (e).

### Discovered Attacks in 3D

Discovered attacks are the flip side of blocking, generally when the
blocking piece is a friend.

Figure 163 shows a similar situation as in the previous figures, but
with 4 of the 6 blocking pieces replaced with White pieces. When any of
the six blocking pieces move, they'll discover an attack by the rook,
even the pair of Black knights; a []{#self_discovered_attack
.anchor}*self-discovered attack*[]{.indexref
entry="self-discovered attack:If a mutually pinned piece moves it discovers an attack on the other."}.

![[]{#_Ref72508495 .anchor}Figure 163: BPD; Types of Discovered
Attacks](media/image164.png){alt="A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated with low confidence"
width="6.5in" height="6.111805555555556in"}

Pieces which if they move will discover an attack are shown with red
halos. Pieces exposed to the discovered attacks are on raised tiles. (a)
pawn discovers attack on king, (b) pawn or duke discover attack on
queen, (c) white bishop discovers attack on the black bishop, (d)
knights self-discover attack on the other, (e) duke discovers attack on
rook. Advancement manifolds suppressed.

The canonical invariant of straight-line advances yields several
*derivative invariants* in 2D chess, which are *not preserved* by planar
moves and advancement squares.

1.  A piece "in the way" blocks the attack -- planar blocking might not,
    nor quark attacks.

2.  The blocking piece can be captured -- not so in mutual blocking, nor
    some end tiles.

3.  The demise of a blocking piece restores the original attack - always
    true for linear attacks, not always true for quadrant attacks.

All three of these have exceptions in 3D chess. We've already seen
number 1, when there is more than one simultaneous attack on a piece
(linear, quark, duplex), a single blocker may not suffice. Let's
consider number 2.

### Blocker Bears the Attack

In 2D chess, when a piece is moved to block an attack, it is a
derivative invariant that it *comes under attack* itself. Whether or not
a blocking piece comes under attack in 3D depends on three factors; the
type of attack, where the blocking piece moves to, and on ancillary
pieces. If it does not move to the perimeter or an end tile, it comes
under attack. If it moves to the perimeter, but not an end tile, it
avoids attack by creating a mutual block, except in the case of a linear
attack. A linear attack cannot be converted to a mutual block because
the blocking piece can move to only *one* perimeter. There are at least
two independent planes and the only perimeter tile they have in common
is occupied by the piece under attack.

The interesting cases are when it moves to an end tile.

From the perspective of the attacking piece, an end tile is in the
quadrant and thus blocks the attack, but it is also a *linear move* for
the attacking piece and that move might be blocked in the *other
quadrant* and in the *other plane(s)*. If blocked in all, then the
blocking piece *does not come under attack*. How unexpected.

There are four possibilities. Getting them confused will bring a smile
to your opponent's face, so each has been given a descriptive name.
We'll task the rook once again to lead us, but the situations to be
considered have their exact equivalents for the bishop, duke, and queen,
and to the extent possible given limited range and direction, the pawn
and king. The knight gets a pass.

Figure 164 shows a White rook attacking Black's bishop and duke on the
king level. Black has four potential blocking moves to end tiles which
show the four []{#end_tile_types .anchor}*end tile types*[]{.indexref
entry="end tile types:Four end tile types, they determine blocking vulnerabilities."}.
A new decorator strategy is employed in the figures to come. The final
perimeter sports open diamonds. This indicates that while pieces there
will block the move, the attacking piece itself cannot access them.
There are open diamonds for apex, between, and end tiles. End tiles with
a solid black diamond are legal moves for the attacking piece; small
diamond means advance is legal in *one* plane, larger diamonds *two*
planes, and a large rhombus *three* planes (duke only).

![[]{#_Ref72749099 .anchor}Figure 164: BPD; End
Blocks](media/image165.png){alt="A screenshot of a video game Description automatically generated with low confidence"
width="6.5in" height="6.111805555555556in"}

White rook is quadrant attacking Black's bishop and duke on the king
level. Hollow decorators indicate mutual blocking on end or between
tiles, a small red diamond inside the hollow means it's an apex tile. A
small solid black diamond inside a hollow means the attack is blocked in
the other planes. If advance to an end tile is open in another plane
(K8,4) it's a *poltergeist block*[]{.indexref
entry="poltergeist block:A vulnerable block, blocker is capturable in another plane."}
(a). If blocked, but becomes open if the attacked piece moves, it's a
*fickle block*[]{.indexref
entry="fickle block:A risky block, if the target moves away, the blocker is vulnerable."}
(b). If blocked so the attacked piece can move away, yet the blocking
piece stays uncovered, then it's a *stonewall block*[]{.indexref
entry="stonewall block:A strong block, if the target moves way, the blocker is safe."}
(c), and if closer to the attacking piece than the perimeter it's a
*long stonewall block*[]{.indexref
entry="long stonewall block:A stonewall block on a non-perimeter end tile, closer to the attacker."}
(d).

Figure 165 shows Black moving his bishop to the end tile K1,5 hoping to
block the quadrant attack on his other bishop. While it does so,
momentarily, the rook can capture it in the right vertical plane. Call
this a []{#poltergeist_block .anchor}*poltergeist block*[]{.indexref
entry="poltergeist block:A vulnerable block, blocker is capturable in another plane."};
it's safe in the attack plane, but not in the intersecting plane.

![[]{#_Ref72749114 .anchor}Figure 165: BPD; Poltergeist
Block](media/image166.png){width="6.5in" height="6.388888888888889in"}

While Black's advance of his black bishop to K1,5 puts it in a mutual
block with both the duke and the other bishop in the horizontal plane,
it itself is vulnerable to capture in the right vertical plane, and thus
only temporarily blocks the attacks. This is a *poltergeist
block*[]{.indexref
entry="poltergeist block:A vulnerable block, blocker is capturable in another plane."}
(a); the blocking piece is not long for this world.

Figure 166 shows Black settling for defending his white bishop by moving
his black bishop to K5,1. This is also a mutual block (and pin), but now
the rook is blocked from capturing it in a vertical plane by the KN
pawn. However, if the white bishop moves, then the rook can capture the
black bishop in the horizontal level. Call this a []{#fickle_block
.anchor}*fickle block*[]{.indexref
entry="fickle block:A risky block, if the target moves away, the blocker is vulnerable."};
it's a block, but a vulnerable one. It is a special case of a mutual
block.

![[]{#_Ref72750150 .anchor}Figure 166: BPD; Fickle
Block](media/image167.png){alt="A screenshot of a video game Description automatically generated with medium confidence"
width="6.5in" height="6.111805555555556in"}

Black moves his black bishop to K5,1 to block the rook attack on his
white bishop. It works, neither piece is under attack, for White's
attack in the left vertical plane is blocked by the KN pawn. However, if
the bishop originally under attack (white) moves away, the blocking
piece (black) comes under attack in the horizontal plane; the mutual
block was also a mutual pin. This is a *fickle block*[]{.indexref
entry="fickle block:A risky block, if the target moves away, the blocker is vulnerable."}
(b). Note the single plane decorator on K4,7.

Figure 167 shows Black using his knight to block the attack on the duke.
It is an effective block, but *not* a mutual block; if the knight moves
away, yes, the duke is under attack again, but if the duke moves away
the knight is *not* under attack. The rook's linear attack on it is
blocked in *both* planes, by the pair of White pawns. Call this a
[]{#stonewall_block .anchor}*stonewall block*[]{.indexref
entry="stonewall block:A strong block, if the target moves way, the blocker is safe."};
it is a secure block.

![[]{#_Ref72754140 .anchor}Figure 167: BPD; Stonewall
block](media/image168.png){width="6.5in" height="6.111805555555556in"}

The knight blocks the rook attack on the duke by moving to an end tile
which is already protected from attack by the pair of White pawns. Thus,
it is not a mutual block. The rook's advancement rectangles are only 2x3
in both planes. Note the linear decorator shows legal advance only to
perimeter 1, perimeter 2 is blocked, no decorator at all. This is a
*stonewall block*[]{.indexref
entry="stonewall block:A strong block, if the target moves way, the blocker is safe."}
(c).

Figure 168 shows Black advancing his black bishop to and end tile not on
the perimeter. This looks like a quadrant block; the blocking piece
would normally be vulnerable, but because it is on an end tile, an
attack on it must be a linear move. If blocked in all planes, the piece
is safe. It's an extended stonewall block[]{.indexref
entry="stonewall block:A strong block, if the target moves way, the blocker is safe."},
but they can extend down the line of end tiles as far as perimeter 1,
all the way to the attacking piece. Call this a []{#long_stonewall_block
.anchor}*long stonewall block*[]{.indexref
entry="long stonewall block:A stonewall block on a non-perimeter end tile, closer to the attacker."},
it is a secure block.

![Diagram Description automatically generated with medium

[]{#_Ref72754153 .anchor}Figure 168: BPD; Long Stonewall Block

Black advances his black bishop to block the rook attack on his duke but
moves it to an end tile not even on the perimeter. The piece is safe
because the linear attack on this tile is blocked even earlier than the
perimeter the duke is on. This is a *long stonewall block*[]{.indexref
entry="long stonewall block:A stonewall block on a non-perimeter end tile, closer to the attacker."}
(d). Note the pair of stonewall decorators in the setup figure in the
4x4 advancement square attacking the duke (Figure 164).

### Restored Attack

The third listed derivative invariant is the []{#restored_attack
.anchor}*restored attack*[]{.indexref
entry="restored attack:When capturing a blocking piece restores the original attack."};
when a blocking piece is captured, the original attack is restored. The
attacker, blocker and target were all in the same *line*; after capture,
the attacker and target are still in the same line, with the target
still in the same direction, but now closer. When the attacker captured
the blocker, the advancement manifold shrunk, but in 2D the advancement
manifold is just a line; all the tiles in the smaller manifold (shorter
line) were also in the larger, []{#original_manifold .anchor}*original
manifold*[]{.indexref
entry="original manifold:The initial advancement manifold prior to capturing a blocking piece."}.
Thus, the attack is restored.

In 3D, if the attacker captures the blocker, it will likewise be in a
new advancement manifold. It will be in the same *plane*, or at least in
one of the original planes, but if the *direction* of the attack has
changed, the new advancement manifold *may not be fully subsumed* by the
original one. The result is []{#beyond_tiles .anchor}*extant tiles*,
this time caused not by advance and retreat, but rather because the
direction of the attack has changed. An ancillary piece in any extant
tile will prevent the attack from being restored.

Tiles a blocking piece can move to which if captured will result in
extant tiles[]{.indexref
entry="extant tile:Tiles beyond the original manifold which may thwart a restored attack."}
beyond the original advancement manifold of the attack piece are called
[]{#shield_tiles .anchor}*shield tiles*. If there is an ancillary piece
anywhere in the associated extant tiles, the attack will not be
restored. Think science fiction, spacecraft with 'shields' which protect
them from attack. The blocking piece is gone, but so is the attack, and
the defender has regained the initiative. There are rich gambit
opportunities here.

Where the shield tiles occur depends on the type of attack (linear or
quadrant), and the type of block (linear, planar, or quadrant). Restored
attacks cannot happen for mutual blocks because there is no vulnerable
blocking piece. The next few figures cover the permutations.

For a linear block, when the attacker captures the blocker, the attacker
and target are still in the same *planes*, and the target still lies in
the same direction. The new advancement manifold will be a subset of the
other. The attack is restored. This is the case most like 2D.

For a planar attack, the attacker can capture the blocker in only one
plane. This moves it out of the other plane(s) and so it is now
attacking the target in only *one* plane; the degree of coverage has
been *reduced*. In the plane of motion, the target will be in one of two
*new* directions, one of the quadrants on either side of the original
linear attack, and the new attack is now a *quadrant* attack. If the
target is far enough away (3 tiles or more) there will be shield tiles
in the new attack quadrant.

For a quadrant or quiet attack, the permutations compound, but the basic
principle remains the same; any ancillary piece on any of the extant
tiles[]{.indexref
entry="extant tile:Tiles beyond the original manifold which may thwart a restored attack."},
will prevent the restoration of the attack. There is no analog in 2D for
shield tiles.

3D chess is richer than 2D.

New decorators are introduced for the shield tiles. They are just
compressed versions of existing decorators, flattened diamonds, but
actual shield shapes would be good as well.

Figure 169 shows a restored *linear* attack in three snapshots. The rook
threatens the queen, the knight jumps into the line between them
blocking the attack with a linear block, which the rook captures,
restoring the attack.

![[]{#_Ref72828026 .anchor}Figure 169: BPD; Restored Linear
Attack](media/image170.png){alt="A picture containing diagram Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="6.195138888888889in"}

Three snapshots of a restored linear attack. The knight jumps into the
line between them blocking the rook's attack on the queen in a linear
block (a). The rook takes the knight with a linear move via 3x5
advancement rectangle (b) which restores the attack (c). The new
advancement rectangle (also 3x5) is fully subsumed by the original 5x9
advancement rectangle (ghosted). Note, the single plane linear decorator
directly in front of the rook (a). In the restored attack[]{.indexref
entry="restored attack:When capturing a blocking piece restores the original attack."},
the rook got past the Black pawn in the vertical plane, so that is now a
double plane linear decorator (c).

Figure 170 shows a restored *planar* attack in three snapshots. The rook
threatens the queen, the knight jumps into quadrant 3 blocking the
attack with a planar block, which the rook captures, restoring the
attack, but it is now a quadrant attack; it is no longer a linear
attack.

![[]{#_Ref72833215 .anchor}Figure 170: BPD; Restored Planar

Three snapshots of a restored quadrant attack. The knight jumps into
quadrant 3 blocking the rook's attack on the queen in a planar block
(a). The rook takes the knight with a quadrant move via 3x3 advancement
rectangle (b) which restores the attack (c). The new advancement
manifold is a 4x4 advancement square that is fully subsumed by the
original 5x9 advancement rectangle (ghosted). Note the end tile
decorators change from two planes to one plane as they pass over the
Black pawn on the level below.

Figure 171 shows another *restored* attack in three snapshots. The rook
threatens the queen, the knight jumps into quadrant 4 onto a *shield
tile*[]{.indexref
entry="snapdragon tile:Tiles where capture may not restore the original attack."}
blocking the attack with a planar block, which the rook captures, but
there *are no ancillary pieces* in the *extant tiles*[]{.indexref
entry="extant tile:Tiles beyond the original manifold which may thwart a restored attack."},
so it restores the attack. At the end, the rook and queen are
counterattacking each other.

blocking the rook's attack on the queen in a planar block (a). The rook

around the pawn threatening the rook in a one-way attack.

Three snapshots of a planar block. The knight jumps into quadrant 4 onto

blocking the rook's attack on the queen in a planar block (a). The rook

extant tiles, and the queen is again peeking around the pawn.

Three snapshots of a planar block. The knight jumps into quadrant 4 onto
an active shield tile[]{.indexref

blocking the rook's attack on the queen in a planar block (a). The rook
takes the knight with a quadrant move via 4x4 advancement rectangle (b)
which now threatens the queen with a 4x4 quadrant attack. This fails to
restore the attack, however, because the White pawn in the extant
tiles[]{.indexref
entry="extant tile:Tiles beyond the original manifold which may thwart a restored attack."}
is now in a *quiet* block with the queen (c).

Figure 174 shows a basic rook quadrant with a 5x5 advancement square,
and then four locations for a target piece (a queen), three between
tiles, and finally the apex tiles. For each location of the queen the
shield tiles are shows. The patterns are complex and fascinating.

![[]{#_Ref72856948 .anchor}Figure 174: BPD; Shield Tiles for Quadrant
Blocks](media/image175.png){alt="Diagram, schematic Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="6.305555555555555in"}

Shown are the shield tiles for four perimeter locations on a 5x5
advancement square (a), represented by the queen. The extant
tiles[]{.indexref
entry="extant tile:Tiles beyond the original manifold which may thwart a restored attack."}
are not shown, but as a set encompass tiles one or two rows deep on
three sides of the quadrant. For between tile #1, there are 9 (b). For
between tile #2, there are 6 (c). For between tile #3, there are 10, and
for the apex tile, there are 14, more than half the tiles in the
advancement square. Shield tiles don't appear to be rare.

Out of the 25 tiles in a 5x5 advancement square, 17 tiles are potential
places to capture a blocking piece. Averaged over the 9 locations on the
perimeter (linear & quadrant) where the target piece could be, that's
(2\*(3+9+6+10) + 14)/9 = 70/9 = 7.8 tiles, 46% - almost half. It's about
as likely as not that a blocking piece will be on a shield tile. For 2D
chess, it's zero.

That's going to have a big impact[]{.indexref
entry="impact:Measures of a pieceâs ability to affect the game; range, PPR, & stab."}
on gambits.

### Cognitive Load

Where did all this nonintuitive complexity come from?

It is a direct consequence of *extant tiles*, which are a direct
consequence of the *advancement square*. The debunked *RAM rule*
(Rectangular Advancement Manifold) of Chapter 1 does not result in
extant tiles. With the RAM rule, there is no peeking, there are no
trapdoor moves, and every captured blocking piece fully restores the
attack, doing so with a smaller RAM, so no shield tiles either. There's
no planar blocking and quadrant blocking is predominantly on the same
side of the apex line as the target, so no quiet blocking[]{.indexref
entry="quiet blocking:Earlier piece on the far side of the advancement manifold blocks."}
either, thus their pin and discover cousins go away as well. Mutual
blocking and mutual pinning also disappear.

There are no fickle or stonewall blocks, they all degrade to
poltergeists. Life would be simpler.

Recall the justification for the advancement square, why it was chosen
over the RAM rule; preserve openings (advancement rectangle) and reduce
power projection to be closer to 2D.

Perhaps the higher PPR[]{.indexref
entry="PPR:Power projection ratio, portion of the board reachable in 1 move."}
would not be a problem.

Perhaps a clever initial position at the start of the game would prevent
the major pieces from moving until a few pawns got out of the way, say
three pawns on each level, neatly hemming all the major pieces. That
means each player starts with 24 pawns, but given their low power
projection, perhaps this would be a better tradeoff.

The RAM rule would dispense with all this extra complexity, it would
preserve more of the derivative invariants of 2D chess, it would violate
fewer of our commonsense expectations about how objects should move;
pieces could fully retreat in one move, attacks after the capture of
blocking pieces would be fully restored, pieces in distant parts of the
board (or in different planes) would not confound the permutations of
what was legal or safe or coverable. It would be cognitively simpler.

Would it feel more like chess? Has your Author led you on a merry goose
chase?

Can this be blamed on the loss of trajectory? Not really, even though
RAM has a well-defined trajectory for linear moves; the closer the
attack is to the apex tile, the less well-defined the trajectory
becomes.

### Sequential Order

Can this be blamed on the loss of sequential order?

With straight line moves, whether in 2D or in other 3D variants, the
tiles in a straight line can be []{#sequentially_ordered
.anchor}*sequentially ordered*[]{.indexref
entry="sequentially ordered:Tiles which can be placed in a reversible order, straight-line & linear."},
like the real numbers. The tiles in an advancement square cannot be
sequenced, like the complex numbers. They can be placed in sets, the
perimeters, which can be ordered, but not the individual tiles. When
complex numbers are represented in polar coordinates, the radii group
the complex numbers into sets, which likewise can be ordered, but not
the individual numbers themselves. Call this []{#pseudo_ordering
.anchor}*pseudo ordering*[]{.indexref
entry="pseudo ordering:Tiles which can only be ordered in groups, such as perimeters."}.

The first chapter presented one more reason to reject the RAM rule. Did
an NxM manifold grow by N tiles at-a-time M times, or did it grow by M
tiles at-a-time N times?

Under the RAM rule not only can't the tiles be sequentially
ordered[]{.indexref
entry="sequentially ordered:Tiles which can be placed in a reversible order, straight-line & linear."};
they can't even be pseudo ordered; there are no unique sets to which
tiles can be assigned that themselves can be ordered.

Without ordering, at least pseudo-ordering[]{.indexref
entry="pseudo ordering:Tiles which can only be ordered in groups, such as perimeters."},
there is no metric upon which to define distance.

### Direction and Distance are Independent

In 2D chess, distance and direction are independent concepts. A rook in
2D, can only cover 4 pieces at once, a bishop 4, a queen 8. In 3D, with
the advancement square, a rook can cover 12 pieces at once, a bishop or
a duke 24 each. How far away the covered pieces are doesn't change this
number. Direction and distance remain *independent*.

Under the RAM rule, direction *depends* on distance (see Figure 6). The
larger the distance, the more directions there are -- direction is a
function of distance. On a large enough board, any base piece has the
potential to cover every other piece on the board; one piece per
direction, the greater the distance the more directions.

Part of the concept of direction and distance is that one can go part
way, and then the rest of the way, *without changing direction.* This is
true in 2D chess, and obviously true in 3D for linear moves, but it is
also true for advancement squares, the second step advances in the same
quadrant as the first. However, it is not generally true for RAM;
special cases exist, but they are in the minority. To keep the
directions the same for a two-step move generally requires *partial*
tiles. The fundamental structure of the board, a regular array of
regular things, is abrogated by the RAM rule.

These are deep invariants which RAM violates. Control of the center is
now better achieved from the corners of the board rather than from the
center. This destroys openings in a whole new way. The best attack is a
retreat?

Here is a list of the negative consequences of the RAM rule.

1.  Openings are broken

2.  PPR[]{.indexref
    entry="PPR:Power projection ratio, portion of the board reachable in 1 move."}
    is too high

3.  Moves are not isotropic

4.  Ambiguity in the growth of an advance

5.  Cannot be pseudo ordered

6.  Direction and distance are not independent

7.  Max cover is range dependent

8.  Fractional distances tend to require fractional tiles

What to do?

### The Value of Dissonance

It has been a joy to search for the rules to 3D chess, rules that truly
*feel like chess*, yet so tightly grouped in phase space, that it really
does seem as if we've discovered the *one right rule set*.

I am, however, dismayed by the cognitive load imposed by the advancement
square. It is exciting, the new things it leads to, but effortless it is
not. I find myself wishing that RAM was the stronger rule; it is so much
easier to visualize, and it comes without the baggage that requires so
much double checking not to miss special edge cases -- and at times it
seems like it's all edge cases.

The RAM rule has a horrendous list of defects, but...but it has such
cognitive simplicity.

If ignorance is the beginning of discovery, perhaps dissonance is the
genesis of insight; either way we need a breakthrough. Can the cognitive
advantages of the RAM rule be put to good use?

Let there be a pair of advancement squares, one from the attacker to the
target, one from the target to the attacker. We observe that where they
overlay each other is the *same set of tiles* which the RAM rule would
have specified, and where they don't are the extant tiles. Envision how
the overlay of these two advancement squares changes as the target walks
the perimeter.

When a piece is being considered for advancement, *two* advancement
squares should be visualized; an []{#advance_square .anchor}*advance
square*[]{.indexref
entry="advance square:The advancement manifold from attacker to target."},
and a []{#retreat_square .anchor}*retreat square*[]{.indexref
entry="retreat square:The advancement manifold from target to attacker."}.

Figure 175 shows the overlapping advancement squares for advance and
retreat tiles for a rook attack on a knight as the knight walks the
perimeter of a 4x4 advancement square from a near end tile, to apex
tile, to far end tile. Where the two advancement squares overlay each
other is the set of RAM tiles, where they don't are the extant tiles
(*opposite* sides, dimmed). As the knight walks the perimeter the
retreat square[]{.indexref
entry="retreat square:The advancement manifold from target to attacker."}
tracks it. As the knight approaches the apex, the overlay region
increases until the advance and retreat squares overlay each other
completely; at that point there are no extant tiles. As the walk
continues, the extant tiles show up on the *other* sides of the advance
square[]{.indexref
entry="advance square:The advancement manifold from attacker to target."}.

Where the *retreat* square[]{.indexref
entry="retreat square:The advancement manifold from target to attacker."}
extends beyond the RAM tiles are the extant tiles which lead to peeking
and trapdoor moves; where the *advance* square[]{.indexref
entry="advance square:The advancement manifold from attacker to target."}
extends beyond the RAM tiles are the extant tiles which lead to quiet,
fickle, and stonewall blocks[]{.indexref
entry="quiet blocking:Earlier piece on the far side of the advancement manifold blocks."}.
When the knight reaches the far end tile, it becomes ambiguous which
quadrant is the advance square and which the retreat square. (If the
knight walks the perimeter in the opposite direction, they swap.) This
is because the attack is now a linear move, not a quadrant move. Treated
as an advancement rectangle, the advance and retreat manifolds fully
overlap. This analysis also applies to the duke. (The case for the
bishop will be left as an exercise for the extremely motivated Intrepid
Reader.)

The extant tiles of the advance square lie *inside* the outer edges of
the attack advancement square (perimeter), call them []{#A_tiles
.anchor}*A tiles*. The extant tiles of the retreat square lie *outside*
the inner edges of the attack advancement square, call them []{#R_tiles
.anchor}*R tiles*.

This one view gets us everything except the shield tiles. I'll take it.

![[]{#_Ref73616368 .anchor}Figure 175: BPD; Overlaid Advance and Retreat
Advancement
Squares](media/image176.png){alt="A screenshot of a video game Description automatically generated with medium confidence"
width="6.5in" height="7.0in"}

Knight walks the perimeter of a 4x4 rook attack from a near end tile (a)
through the apex (c) to the far end tile (f). The advance
square[]{.indexref
entry="advance square:The advancement manifold from attacker to target."}
is fixed, the retreat square[]{.indexref
entry="retreat square:The advancement manifold from target to attacker."}
follows the knight. Their overlay is the RAM move. The extant tiles are
where they don't overlay (dimmed decorators). Pieces on the retreat
extant tiles (R tiles) create peeking and trapdoor moves. Pieces on the
advance extant tiles (A tiles) block the attack. Partial advance to a
RAM tile maintains the threat in the same manifold. For the linear move,
the advancement rectangle has been suppressed. End tile decorators were
suppressed on the retreat square[]{.indexref
entry="retreat square:The advancement manifold from target to attacker."}
to reduce clutter, but the apex decorators remain.

Capturing a blocking piece in the advance extant tiles will result in a
change in the direction of the attack (it will now be from an adjacent
quadrant), while capturing a blocking piece on an end tile of the
retreat square[]{.indexref
entry="retreat square:The advancement manifold from target to attacker."}
will result in a linear attack consisting of the advance quadrant and
the adjacent quadrant. Capturing planar blocks always changes direction,
from a linear attack to a quadrant attack.

It is instructive to consider a linear move as consisting of two parts.
There is the straight-line part, which is all that RAM would specify
(1xN), and then there are the pair of flanking quadrants, the overlay of
which is the line of end tiles to the target tile.

Our mistake has been to think that a move is fully characterized by a
single advancement square. From a legality perspective, yes, but from a
tactical perspective, no. It's *always* a pair of advancement squares;
one from attacker to target (the *advance square*[]{.indexref
entry="advance square:The advancement manifold from attacker to target."})
and the other from the target to the attacker (the *retreat
square*[]{.indexref
entry="retreat square:The advancement manifold from target to attacker."}).

The advance and retreat squares overlay each other by one row of tiles
in a linear move and fully overlay for an apex move. The set of overlay
tiles is just the tiles of the debunked RAM rule. It is useful to
increase the resolution of the RAM concept by decomposing it into an
*interior* and a *boundary*. Partial advances into the RAM interior can
be continued without exceeding the original attack advancement manifold.
The RAM parts and the extant tiles, tell us everything we need to know
about peeking, trapdoor moves, and whether a block is linear, planar,
quadrant, quiet, mutual, poltergeist, fickle, stonewall, or shield.

This daunting complexity can be simplified a bit by invoking an acronym,
RRAPS.

Check the *RAM* tiles, they are easy to visualize and if not clear, the
move is blocked -- analysis done. Check the *retreat* extant tiles; if
empty, no peaking is going on so this is not a trapdoor move; the piece
will be able to return to its current position in one move. Check the
*advance* extant tiles, this is where the quiet blocks will hide. Check
the *perimeter* (for mutual blocks/pins) including the end tiles for
poltergeist, fickle and stonewall blocks. Optionally, check each
*shield* tile for if any of its extant tiles are occupied, moving there
first puts the target tile out of reach.

Software intended to implement this game will need to be very, very
clear in how it represents these tiles.

In 2D, the advance and retreat advancement manifolds fully overlay each
other, but in 3D, they do so only for apex[]{.indexref
entry="apex:The tiles down the diagonal of an advancement square."} and
non-bishop linear moves. Thus peeking[]{.indexref
entry="peeking:A one-way attack because of a third piece on an extant tile."}
and trapdoor moves become possible.

In 2D, when a piece advances out an advancement manifold[]{.indexref
entry="advancement manifold:Regular region of tiles which must be empty to permit move."},
the set of covered pieces, in both the advance and retreat directions,
is an invariant[]{.indexref
entry="invariant:A pattern which remains constant while other things change."},
but in 3D, the set can change, being driven by ancillary pieces in both
the advance and retreat directions.

Looks like we've found a use for the RAM rule; it makes the nuances of
the advancement square a little easier to grasp.

### Review

The challenge in these last two chapters was to visualize the components
of an attack to avoid surprises. The primary component is the
*advancement square* itself, with its four subcomponents: the *body*,
the *two lines of end tiles*, the *perimeter*, and the *line of apex
tiles*. The various kinds of attacks and blocks depended on which of
these subcomponents the attacker, target and blocker were on. For
*linear* attacks, there were two types of blocks: *linear* and *planar*.
For *quadrant* attacks, there were three types of blocks: *quadrant*,
*quiet* and *mutual*. For most of the *blocking* situations there were
also companion *pins* and *discovered attacks.*

Blocking on end tiles added another set of behaviors. An end tile block
might work in one plane only; the *poltergeist* block, it might work
only until the original target left; *fickle* block, or its
vulnerability might not depend on the target piece at all; the
*stonewall* blocks.

However, it proved useful to visualize two advancement squares, one from
the attacker to the target (*advance square*[]{.indexref
entry="advance square:The advancement manifold from attacker to target."})
and the other from the target to the attacker (*retreat
square*[]{.indexref
entry="retreat square:The advancement manifold from target to attacker."}).
Where they *overlay* each other is equivalent to the *tiles of the RAM
rule*. Where they don't, are the *extant tiles,* in two sets. Those
belonging to the *retreat square*[]{.indexref
entry="advance square:The advancement manifold from attacker to target."}
support *peeking* and t*rapdoor moves,* while those belonging to the
*advance square*[]{.indexref
entry="retreat square:The advancement manifold from target to attacker."}
support *quiet blocking*[]{.indexref
entry="quiet blocking:Earlier piece on the far side of the advancement manifold blocks."}.

The extant tiles also made it easier to judge the prospects of
intermediate advances, such as to capture a blocking piece, and whether
an attack would be *restored*. An intermediate advance to a *shield*
tile meant a change in direction for the final advance which includes
extant tiles outside the original advancement manifold.

An intermediate advance to a RAM *interior* tile allowed a continuation
move to the target that stayed inside the original advancement square,
and would thus always restore a blocked attack.

The acronym *RRAPS* offers advice on how to analysis the tactics of a
potential move.

## Forks

When a piece is developed, it exerts influence on the game; this can be
indirect, as in control of the center, or explicit as in threatening a
piece. A []{#fork .anchor}*fork*[]{.indexref
entry="fork:Simultaneously attacking two or more pieces with one move."}
is where one piece makes *multiple* threats at once.

In 2D this is generally constrained to be just two threats at once: with
some exceptions. Since a base piece in 2D must move in one line, and
since regardless of which line and which direction it moves, any pieces
it was attacking prior to the move will still be under attack after the
move, the forking only occurs in the line that is orthogonal to the line
of motion. So, the best a base piece can do is threaten *two* additional
pieces. The queen can do better than this because it is the combination
of rook and bishop.

In 3D, the opportunity for forks is enhanced in three ways; each of them
increases the number of threats a single piece can instigate.

First, there are now *more than two manifolds* a piece moves in. The
rook when it moves in one plane, can acquire new targets in *two*
planes, while in 2D it could only acquire new targets in *one* line. The
bishop can acquire new targets in *three* planes, and the duke in
*five*.

Second, each plane allows for *more than two pieces* at once to be
threatened. The rook can threaten *four* per plane, while in 2D it could
only threaten *two* per line. The bishop can threaten *six*, while in 2D
it could also only threaten *two*, and the duke can threaten *four*
(where in 2D it could only threaten, ahem, *zero*).

Third, there are now *more than two directions* within a plane. Simply
by shifting its position within a single plane, a base piece may be able
to threaten additional pieces it was not originally covering in that
very plane. When a piece in 2D chess moves along a line, it doesn't
change the directions between it and any other pieces on that line.
However, as we've just seen, when a piece in 3D moves within a plane, it
is quite possible for it to change the direction between it and other
pieces within that plane. In addition to forking by a change of
direction, it is also possible to fork[]{.indexref
entry="fork:Simultaneously attacking two or more pieces with one move."}
by reducing, eliminating, or shifting extant tiles. The former will be
called a []{#drift_fork .anchor}*drift fork*[]{.indexref
entry="drift fork:In-plane fork due to a change in direction."}, and the
latter a []{#focus_fork .anchor}*focus fork*[]{.indexref
entry="focus fork:In-plane fork due to a change in the extant tiles."}.

### Plane Forks

When a piece moves within one plane it also changes which planes
orthogonal to that one it is in. For a linear move it changes at least
1, and for a quadrant move it changes all the others (2 for rook, 3 for
bishop, and 5 for duke), except for the duke duplex move, which changes
only 4. This is just the plain old fork[]{.indexref
entry="fork:Simultaneously attacking two or more pieces with one move."}
of 2D, where all the forking occurs in the orthogonal line. Here, the
forking is occurring in orthogonal planes. Call this a []{#plane_fork
.anchor}*plane fork*[]{.indexref
entry="plane fork:A fork in planes other than the plane of advance."}.[^47]

Figure 176 shows a highly contrived situation where the Black queen is
not attacking any White pieces, but with a single move, contrives to
fork[]{.indexref
entry="fork:Simultaneously attacking two or more pieces with one move."}
all 16 of them. The next figures elaborate.

![[]{#_Ref73543483 .anchor}Figure 176: Forks; Plane Forks
Setup](media/image177.png){alt="Diagram Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="6.361111111111111in"}

The Black queen is under attack only from the forward knight. She moves
to the q-tile at Q3,3 forking all 16 of White's pieces, 8 as a rook, 4
as a bishop and 4 as a duke. The dimmed decorators show her bishop and
duke attacks prior to the move. Note that none of White's 16 pieces are
on a decorated tile. The rook decorators are not shown, but they are
easy to visualize; none of White's pieces are on the queen level, nor on
either back plane. She may have advanced to Q3,3 as either a rook, a
bishop, or a duke; regardless she has gone from forking none to forking
all.

Figure 177 shows the eight rook-like forks, all in the vertical planes
since the queen advanced in the horizontal plane. Neither the White
queen nor her rooks are counter attacking as the forks have the queen
peeking around White's pawns. Both knights, both rooks, the queen, and
three pawns are forked, all via 3x3 advancement squares.

![[]{#_Ref73544457 .anchor}Figure 177: Forks; Plane Fork via Queen's
Rook
Attacks](media/image178.png){alt="Diagram Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="6.361111111111111in"}

From her new location the queen forks 8 pieces as a rook. Neither White
queen nor either rook is counter attacking because of the pawns. All
attacks are in the vertical planes via 3x3 advancement squares.

Figure 178 shows the four bishop-like forks, all in the forward planes
since the queen advanced in the outward planes. The king, two pawns, and
the king side stack are under attack. Note that the stack is counter
attacking by bishop decay.

![[]{#_Ref73546070 .anchor}Figure 178: Forks; Plane Fork via Queen's
Bishop
Attacks](media/image179.png){alt="Shape Description automatically generated with medium confidence"
width="6.5in" height="6.361111111111111in"}

From her new location the queen forks 4 pieces as a bishop, all in
forward planes; the king, two pawns, and the king-side stack, which is
counter attacking by bishop decay.

Figure 179 shows the four duke-like forks, all in the right and left
cross planes[]{.indexref
entry="cross planes:Duke planes come in planes connecting opposing board faces."}
since the queen advanced in the major plane. Three pawns and the
queen-side stack are under attack. Note that the stack is counter
attacking by duke decay.

Obviously, this is an atypical plane fork[]{.indexref
entry="plane fork:A fork in planes other than the plane of advance."},
but it demonstrates what each base piece plane fork[]{.indexref
entry="plane fork:A fork in planes other than the plane of advance."}
looks like and deepens our understanding of the queen.

![[]{#_Ref73547324 .anchor}Figure 179: Forks; Plane Fork via Queen's
Duke
Attacks](media/image180.png){alt="A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated with low confidence"
width="6.5in" height="6.361111111111111in"}

From her new location the queen forks 4 pieces as a duke, all in the
left and right cross planes[]{.indexref
entry="cross planes:Duke planes come in planes connecting opposing board faces."};
three pawns, and the queen-side stack, which is counter attacking by
duke decay.

Would it be odd if simultaneous bishop and duke stack decays formed a
fusion capture?

### Drift Forks

A drift fork[]{.indexref
entry="fork:Simultaneously attacking two or more pieces with one move."}
occurs when a piece changes its location within a plane, and additional
pieces in that *same* plane come under attack which were not previously
threatened.

Figure 180 shows a White rook in a horizontal plane along with four
Black pieces. The Black pieces are in two mutual blocking situations,
two pieces each. While this does put them in a mutual pinning situation,
none of the pieces are in immediate danger. That is about to change.

![[]{#_Ref73450997 .anchor}Figure 180: Forks; Drift Fork for a
Rook](media/image181.png){alt="A picture containing diagram Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="6.305555555555555in"}

An example of a drift fork[]{.indexref
entry="fork:Simultaneously attacking two or more pieces with one move."}
where the moving piece forks four pieces in the drift plane. A White
rook has a pair of knights in a mutual blocking/pinning situation in
quadrant 1 (a), and also has a bishop and a duke in a mutual
blocking/pinning situation over in quadrant 2 (b). The rook drifts into
the center of board (c). Now the rook is attacking every piece on this
level (a 4-way fork[]{.indexref
entry="fork:Simultaneously attacking two or more pieces with one move."}),
each in a different quadrant. One knight in quadrant 1 and the bishop in
quadrant 3 (d), and the duke in quadrant 2 along with the other knight
in quadrant 4 (e). Haloed pieces show which ones are under attack, the
ghost rook the rook advance. For clarity, (a) & (b) are split views
before the move, (d) & (e) split views after the move.

There is no analog in 2D chess for this kind of fork[]{.indexref
entry="fork:Simultaneously attacking two or more pieces with one move."}.

### Focus Forks

A focus fork[]{.indexref
entry="focus fork:In-plane fork due to a change in the extant tiles."}
occurs when a piece changes its location within a plane to reduce or
eliminate extant tiles which were previously blocking an attack. It is
characterized by the target pieces lying in separate RAM regions.

Figure 181 shows the White rook hoping to fork[]{.indexref
entry="fork:Simultaneously attacking two or more pieces with one move."}
a pair of knights in its horizontal plane, but each knight is in a
mutual blocking situation with a king. The extant tiles are shown dimmed
(a). Two possible moves for the rook are shown. The first move (b)
*reduces* the extant tiles around the Black king from three rows to one
and *moves* the single row of extant tiles under the White king from one
side of the advancement square to the other, in both cases forking the
pair of rooks (c).

The second move (d) *eliminates* the extant tiles around the Black king
by locating so as to place that knight on the rook's apex tile, and
while it still moves the single row of extant tiles under the White king
to the other side of the advancement square, it also enlarges the extant
tiles from one row to two, but as there are no other pieces in them,
this again forks both knights (e).

![[]{#_Ref73464457 .anchor}Figure 181: Forks; Focus Fork for a
Rook](media/image182.png){alt="Diagram Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="6.305555555555555in"}

Two examples of a focus fork, in-plane forking by changing the extant
tiles. In the setup the rook cannot capture the knights because of
mutual blocking with one king or the other (a). The rook advances (b) to
shrink the extant tiles (Black king) or move them (White king) such that
there are no longer any ancillary pieces in them (c). The rook advances
to a different tile (d) eliminating the extant tiles near the Black king
(apex attack) altogether, even if that increases the number of extant
tiles in the other manifold (White king), just so long as they become
empty (e).

The difference between a drift fork and a focus fork is that a drift
fork changes the *direction* of the attack, while the focus fork changes
the location or size of the *extant* tiles.

By moving attack closer to the apex tile, the number of extant tiles is
reduced, becoming eliminated at the apex tile itself. This looks like a
generally sound tactic. The intent of a focus fork[]{.indexref
entry="focus fork:In-plane fork due to a change in the extant tiles."}
is to make it more difficult to block. Note that in the focus forks the
direction of the attacks did not change.

In a drift fork[]{.indexref
entry="fork:Simultaneously attacking two or more pieces with one move."},
the intent is to generate more attacks by changing in which direction
they occur. In the previous figure, the two original attacks were in
quadrants 1 and 2 (blocked), after the drift, there were attacks in
quadrants 1, 2, 3, & 4.

There is no analog in 2D chess for this kind of fork[]{.indexref
entry="fork:Simultaneously attacking two or more pieces with one move."}.

### Review

This chapter presented a taxonomy of forks; *plane forks* (most like
their 2D predecessors), *drift forks* which leverage a change in
direction within a plane and *focus forks* which leveraged a change in
the extant tiles.

+========================================================================================+

Indeed.

Having claimed discovery of the *one right rule set* for 3D chess, it
remains to be seen if play shows they are still the same pieces,
expanded yet true to their *original natures*, or whether these
so-called discovered rules have corrupted them into *different* things.
Is 3D chess, with planar moves (and that pesky advancement square),
still chess?

There is no more wiggle room, the rules have been set, the interactions
deduced. It is time to explore the tactical *consequences* of the rules
we fervently hope to have been truly discovered. Can they, might they,
do they even have a chance to, yield play that *feels like chess*?

We begin with the endgame.

## Endgames

It is a popular misconception that chess masters can look a dozen moves
ahead. By move 4 of 2D chess there are some 300 billion possible
permutations. A chess master knows how to prune this down to a more
manageable level with a few tricks; chunking[]{.indexref
entry="chunking:Reducing complexity via pattern of moves, or architecture of position."}
which treats a group of pieces as an entity, instinctive rejection of
poor moves honed by training and years of experience, and
[]{#retrograde_analysis .anchor}*retrograde analysis*[]{.indexref
entry="retrograde analysis:Analyze a cause and effect chain in reverse order."}
which drives the game toward known conditions which, from a great deal
of study, practice and thought, the master already knows how to deal
with.

The endpoint of retrograde analysis[]{.indexref
entry="retrograde analysis:Analyze a cause and effect chain in reverse order."}
is the endgame. To master chess, in any dimension, one must master a
basic set of endgames. In this chapter, a few of the most important
endgames are considered, analyzed, and contrasted with their 2D
equivalents. Under planar moves, they are substantially the same.

White will be on the offense and first to move, Black on the defensive,
typically with only his king. White will have one or two additional
pieces. If both players have only their kings, the game is a stalemate.

### Two Rooks[]{.indexref entry="Endgame:Simple scenarios near the end of the game where mate is achieved."}

In 2D, the simplest mate is with two rooks against a lone king. The
friendly king's only role is to stay out of the way. Basically, the two
rooks form a double wall and then leapfrog the back wall to the front
checking the king and forcing him toward a side of the board. Once
against the side of the board, the last leapfrog results in checkmate.
The only tricky part is to shuttle the rooks back and forth to distant
parts of the board whenever the king gets close enough to threaten the
front most one. Mate is possible from any position in no more than 7
moves.

The mate in 3D is exactly the same, with exactly the same algorithm,
with exactly the same move limit; *feels like chess*.

Figure 182 shows the basic idea in both 2D (a) and 3D (b).

![[]{#_Ref75606668 .anchor}Figure 182: Endgame Two
Rooks](media/image183.png){alt="Shape Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="7.553472222222222in"}

White uses his two rooks to form a double wall and then repeatedly
leapfrogs the back wall to the front, checking the Black king and
forcing him toward a side/face of the board. The queen-side rook moves
first in this example, then the king-side rook. The White king just
stays out of the way. Ghost pieces indicate the moves. The algorithm in
2D (a) translates perfectly to 3D (b).

Having a two-piece material advantage at the end of the game is unusual
between players of equal skill, so this endgame is rare in tournament
play. However, knowing how to do it is important from a skill
perspective, and in the case of 3D it suggests some of the tips and
tricks necessary to promote a 2D algorithm for use on the 3D board. In
this case, the algorithms are identical, just six faces to confine the
opposing king against, instead of four sides; pick one and compress.

### One Rook[]{.indexref entry="Endgame:Simple scenarios near the end of the game where mate is achieved."}

A more common endgame results when one player manages to obtain a
material advantage of one rook and then hangs onto it throughout the
midgame. In this mate algorithm, however, the friendly king has an
important and critical role to play; the lone rook cannot achieve
checkmate without help.

The king has two roles; protect the rook from capture and block the
opposing king from skipping over the wall when the rook advances it. The
algorithm is essentially the same, but now the king must be confined to
an edge of the board and therefore one more dimension in which he must
be confined. Four sides in 2D, twelve edges in 3D; pick one and
compress.

The next few figures show the basic algorithm for a rook and a king to
checkmate a long king in both 2D and 3D chess. The White king is
positioned opposite the Black king so that when the White rook advances
to compress the space the Black king is in; he cannot slip through the
wall. The Black king is forced to retreat, but advances toward the rook
to threaten it; either the king moves to defend, or the rook simply
slides to distant perpendicular edge of the board out of reach. Ghost
pieces show the next two moves for each player.

Optimal play is captured below from a position 7 moves from checkmate.

The White decorators are shown, those for Black add clutter and are
therefore suppressed. The White king obstructs the Black king the most
when he positions himself on what would be the hotspot tile, if only the
king had a larger reach.

White's king is on a hotspot tile of the Black king. He is therefore
free to check the king and force it to the face of the board. The Black
king does so but approaches the rook threatening it. The rook simply
flees to the side of the board, and king pursues, but its hopeless.

White's king advances trying to regain the hotspot
orientation[]{.indexref
entry="orientation:Move from active to fixed piece is either quadrant or linear."}
which Black's pursuit of the rook interrupted. Black advances once again
threatening the rook, who simply moves to within reach of his own king,
but now restricting Black to just two squares in 3D (a) and four squares
in 3D (b).

width="6.5in" height="7.6090277777777775in"}

The White king advances twice regaining the hotspot location (a) but in
3D Black attempts to lure the rook up a level, which would extend his
doom by two moves (b). White declines and lines up his king anyway. In
2D, Black is forced into the corner, but in 3D Black again moves to
threaten the rook and prevents it from mating him from KB8,3, but to no
avail.

![[]{#_Toc210218470 .anchor}Figure 186: Endgame One Rook and King 1 Move

Checkmate](media/image187.png){alt="Shape Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="7.6090277777777775in"}

Having trapped Black in the corner in 2D (a) the rook simply moves to
the side of the board, checkmate. In 3D (b), Black has been able to both
stay out of the corner and even stay off any edge of the board, but the
rook uses a quadrant move to not only advance to the side of the board
but do so a level down where the Black king cannot reach him. Mate in 7.

In general, it requires a couple of additional moves to confine the
opposing king against the third dimension, but with clever abstraction,
the algorithm is identical on both boards.

This is exactly what was hoped for when a commitment to discovery over
invention was adopted at the start of this quest. For the rook at least,
things are looking good.

### One Queen[]{.indexref entry="Endgame:Simple scenarios near the end of the game where mate is achieved."}

For 3D chess to feel like chess, it must be possible to win a game with
only a one pawn advantage. The route to victory is by promotion, most
often to a queen. In this endgame, White has a king and a queen, but no
other pieces, and Black has only his lone king.

In 2D chess, the queen and king work together to confine Black to a
smaller and smaller region of the board until mate is possible. The
tricky part of the algorithm is that it is relatively easy to
unintentionally leave Black with no legal move, but he is not yet in
check. Stalemate is the result; Black breathes a sigh of undeserved
relief, and White has egg on her face.

This algorithm still works in 3D chess, but it is not the most efficient
one. Because of the addition of the duke, because the unit cell in 3D
(cube) has three features (face, edge, vertex) but the unit cell in 2D
(square) has only two (side, corner), the queen can actually perform
checkmate *without* an assist from her king.

In 2D, she can mate from any position on the board in 9 moves or less.
In the king & rook endgame, hotspot tiles play a tactical role, but in
the king & queen endgame they play a strategic role.

Figure 187 shows an initial position after a White pawn has promoted to
a queen, her king is on an adjacent tile limiting her options as much as
possible and the opposing king is in the center of the board as far as
possible from any face. Worst case scenario for White, best-case
scenario for Black. She advances to attack the Black king from a hotspot
tile; check, and surprise, checkmate -- checkmate in one.

This is indeed a surprise, not only can the queen mate the opposing king
without help from her own king, but she can also do so in the *open*;
she doesn't even have to drive him to a side of the board.[^49]

![[]{#_Ref75859519 .anchor}Figure 187: Endgame of Queen Mate -- Attack
Position](media/image188.png){width="6.5in"
height="6.402777777777778in"}

White has just promoted her KR pawn to a queen and Black has run to the
center of the board. The queen advances to a hotspot tile (ghost queen)
above the king putting him in check -- no wait, *checkmate*, even in the
center of the board. The queen in 3D is a fearsome piece.

Figure 188 shows the queen's attack. The Black king is hosed; even
backing up is no help, for all nine adjacent tiles one plane farther
away are still covered by the queen, and unlike the case in 2D, the
knight tiles are out of reach.

![[]{#_Ref75859550 .anchor}Figure 188: Endgame of Queen Mate -- Queen's
Attack](media/image189.png){alt="A picture containing shape Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="6.402777777777778in"}

To reduce clutter, the queen's coverage has only been indicated around
the king's 5x5x5 sphere of influence. The knight tiles on his level are
just out of reach as are those one level above and below. Surprise, the
9 adjacent tiles one level down are all covered by the queen. The king
has nowhere to go and has been mated in the open.

On an empty board, the queen can reach any tile in just two moves. With
each king in just the right position, it might take her three, and even
though the opposing king can shift the hotspot target tiles with each of
his moves, the worst-case queen mate is a mere 3 moves -- three times
faster than in 2D. Given the increased PPR[]{.indexref
entry="PPR:Power projection ratio, portion of the board reachable in 1 move."}
of the queen on the 3D board, perhaps this is not so unexpected, but the
optimal algorithms are clearly different.

Did we just get blindsided? Not only does the 3D queen not need her king
to assist in the mate, she does not even need to force the king to the
side of the board; she can mate him in the very center just by moving to
a hotspot tile. Without access to his bishop apex tiles, he cannot
escape for the knight tiles are out of reach, and the plane immediately
behind him is fully covered by the queen's three base piece advances.
Suggestively, if he could access his duke duplex tiles, then he would be
counter attacking the queen, forcing her to attack from a less dominant
position.

Here is evidence that restricting the king to linear moves is too
restrictive. However, if he is granted access to his bishop and duke
apex tiles, then he can penetrate the single rook wall, and thus both
single and double rook endgames are busted. The queen mate endgame is
not busted, just unusually quick.

For due diligence, a number of variations of the king move were
considered; such as quadrant moves allowed only when in check (the
[]{#fight_or_flight_rule .anchor}*fight or flight rule*[]{.indexref
entry="fight or flight rule:Rejected rule that allows king to make a quadrant move when in check."})
or if any tile in an advancement square is in check the move is blocked
([]{#perimeter_check_rule .anchor}*perimeter check rule*[]{.indexref
entry="perimeter check rule:Rejected rule that blocked king if any perimeter tile was in check."}).
While these two rules work well together, the side-effects do not feel
like chess. Play becomes very nonlocal, dependent upon a friend/foe
distinction foreign to 2D chess, and the very weird possibility of two
kings checking each other merely because one of them was in check by
some other piece.[^50] Every last one of these radical rules yielded
play that failed to feel like chess.

They violated an expectation in chess that it is important to preserve.
When considering a move, a player should only have to think about
whether its *blocked*, what pieces *cover* the destination tile, and
what power can be *projected* from the destination tile; block, cover,
projection. The linear move restriction on the king succeeds here, the
other variations do not.

What the 2D & 3D versions of this endgame have in common is that White
can force a mate from any position unless the Black king can capture the
queen immediately after promotion; the queen is simply more powerful in
3D; and a single pawn advantage remains decisive, as it should be.

On balance, *feels like chess*.

### Two Bishops[]{.indexref entry="Endgame:Simple scenarios near the end of the game where mate is achieved."}

In the context of chess, a []{#fence .anchor}*fence*[]{.indexref
entry="fence:An attempt to confine a king to a portion of the board."}
is the attempt to use one piece to limit the movement of another. This
is most applicable against pawns and kings. In both 2D and 3D, the rook
move is an effective fence[]{.indexref
entry="fence:An attempt to confine a king to a portion of the board."},
neither pawn nor king can cross it; the pawn without coming under
attack, the king not at all since it is illegal for it to move into
check. The rook move []{#cleave .anchor}*cleaves* the board.

In 2D and 3D, the move of a single bishop is not an effective
fence[]{.indexref
entry="fence:An attempt to confine a king to a portion of the board."}.
In 2D, it can threaten a pawn on every other tile, but in 3D, it can't
even do that. And while it prevents the king from making a rook like
move in both realms, it does not cleave[]{.indexref
entry="cleave:To separate the board into disjoint regions."} the board
into disjoint regions. In 2D, the king can slip through with its bishop
move and in 3D it can slip through with either its bishop or duke move.

This is why a king and a single bishop cannot force a mate against a
lone king. However, a pair of bishops can create a stronger
fence[]{.indexref
entry="fence:An attempt to confine a king to a portion of the board."},
one that cleaves the board, at least in 2D. Does it also do so in 3D?

Figure 189 shows the double bishop fence[]{.indexref
entry="fence:An attempt to confine a king to a portion of the board."}
in 2D (a) and 3D (b). In 2D, both pairs of diagonal lines are shown for
two adjacent bishops in the center of the board, and it is clear from
inspection that the king cannot cross them; they have cleaved the board
into four disjoint regions, much like a single rook can. That is the
primary reason why a pair of bishops can mate a lone king.

The case for 3D is complicated by the existence of four planes, so for
clarity part (b) shows only the upward planes for the pair of bishops in
the center of the board. Surprise, surprise, surprise.[^51] The king can
sneak through this fence[]{.indexref
entry="fence:An attempt to confine a king to a portion of the board."}
with his duke move (KN3,5). When right against the fence[]{.indexref
entry="fence:An attempt to confine a king to a portion of the board."},
which ever adjacent king corner the fence[]{.indexref
entry="fence:An attempt to confine a king to a portion of the board."}
'leans' toward will penetrate; 1 tile out of 26. That's less than 4%,
but it's enough. In 3D, the dual bishop fence[]{.indexref
entry="fence:An attempt to confine a king to a portion of the board."}
is []{#porous .anchor}*porous*[]{.indexref
entry="porous:An ineffective fence."}.

This difference, small though it is, impacts the dual bishop endgame
algorithm. Unlike the case for the rook, the double bishop mate
algorithm in 3D is necessarily different than in 2D. While it contains
many of the same elements, it also requires new concepts and new
tactics.

![[]{#_Ref71707804 .anchor}Figure 189: Endgame -- Dual Bishop Fence is
Porous](media/image190.png){alt="Shape Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="7.553472222222222in"}

A pair of bishops form an effective fence[]{.indexref
entry="fence:An attempt to confine a king to a portion of the board."}
in 2D (a), but in 3D (b) it is porous[]{.indexref
entry="porous:An ineffective fence."}; the king can escape via its duke
move. Whichever corner of the king's 26 adjacent cells the bishop
fence[]{.indexref
entry="fence:An attempt to confine a king to a portion of the board."}
'leans' toward is the duke move which penetrates it. The dual bishop
fence[]{.indexref
entry="fence:An attempt to confine a king to a portion of the board."}
in 3D does not cleave[]{.indexref
entry="cleave:To separate the board into disjoint regions."} the board.
For clarity, only the upward planes have been shown.

#### Calculations

It is instructive to compare the number of possible endgame initial
positions between 2D and 3D for the dual bishop mate. We'll make a few
simplifying assumptions to keep the math simple, so our estimates will
only be within a factor of two or so of the actual numbers; close enough
for our purposes.

In 2D, the White king has 64 choices, the Black king cannot be next to
him, so 64 -- 9 = 55. Each bishop has access to half the tiles on the
board, minus one on average for one of the kings being on the same
color, so 31. Bishop power projection is between 7 & 13, say 10. The
Black king cannot be in check nor on a tile occupied by a bishop, so 55
-- 2 -- 10 -- 10 = 33. The number of possible initial positions is
therefore, roughly; 64 \* 31 \* 31 \* 33 = 2\^(6 + 5 + 5 + 5) = 2\^21 =
*2 million*.

In 3D, the White king has 512 choices, each bishop has 256 minus one on
average for one of the kings being on the same color. Bishop power
projection is between 84 and 147, say 116. The Black king does not start
in check, so 512 -- 27 -- 2 -- 116 -- 116 = 251. Therefore, roughly 512
\* 255 \* 255 \* 251 = 2\^(9 + 8 + 8 + 8) = 2\^33 = *8 billion*, about
4,000 times larger.

The 3D board has more symmetries than the 2D board, so converting
initial positions to a canonical form can probably drop this ratio by a
factor of 10, but without some very clear abstractions, this endgame is
extraordinarily difficult.

#### Perfect Play is Unknown

A great deal is known about this endgame, and some of that is covered in
Part V - The Quantum Paradigm, but it remains uncertain if there is a
general algorithm that can force mate from any position. It is known
that a forced mate is possible from a great many positions, many of
which reduce to the 2D algorithm. In addition, the three other planes of
the double wall fence[]{.indexref
entry="fence:A line or plane of covered tiles restricting the advance of some piece."}
can be used to dynamically plug some of the duke holes on the primary
fence[]{.indexref
entry="fence:A line or plane of covered tiles restricting the advance of some piece."}
faster than Black can approach them, leaving the White king to block the
other side as in the standard 2D algorithm. The White king may now only
be able to advance every few moves, slowing it down, but this merely
delays the inevitable (and complicates the algorithm), so it is not
clear that a porous bishop fence[]{.indexref
entry="fence:A line or plane of covered tiles restricting the advance of some piece."}
dooms this endgame.

It is also known that mate can be forced on a 4x4x4 board from any
position.

This suggests a challenge, and a metric for how well this endgame feels
like chess. Consider a research program that studies this endgame on
successfully larger boards, applying the tactics and strategies learned
on each smaller board to the next larger one. There are four possible
outcomes.

1.  Forced mate is possible only on some board smaller than 8x8x8.

2.  Forced mate is possible on an 8x8x8 board, but not on a larger one.

3.  Forced mate becomes impossible on some NxNxN board with N \> 9.

4.  Forced mate is possible on any size board.

The 2D dual bishop mate algorithm works on a board of any size, outcome
#4. Finding an algorithm in 3D that works on any size board is the holy
grail of this research program. Outcomes #2 & #3 will certainly qualify
as *feels like chess*, even though the invariant of 'any size board' is
not preserved.[^52] These simply mean that the bishop has less relative
power on the 3D board compared to the king, in complement to the queen
having more, but all a player has to worry about in the final phases of
the midgame is how to end up with two bishops.

The critical case is #1. If forced mate is possible on a 7x7x7 board,
then most initial positions are a win for White, and the bishop is
simply that much less powerful in 3D; there remains an argument that
play still feels like chess, just more nuanced. However, if forced mate
is only possible on a 6x6x6 board, then roughly (very roughly) half the
initial positions are a win for White and we will be forced to conclude
that this endgame does not work out the same. In both cases, however, as
a practical matter, the players must navigate the end of the midgame so
as to leave a winning position. In 2D, that extra constraint affects
only the number of moves left to checkmate, not its possibility.

### Pawn Races[]{.indexref entry="Endgame:Simple scenarios near the end of the game where mate is achieved."}

Given that a single pawn can decide the game, there is a whole set of
endgames where the last pawn is racing another piece. The other piece
has three strategies: block, capture, or fence. Analysis usually focuses
on a virgin pawn on a rook file; royal pawns are typically gone by the
endgame and those in between often fare worse. For non-rook pawns, or
pawns already advanced, the endgame algorithm is either spatially
translated, or rolled forward.

To block the pawn in 3D requires the opposing piece to be on the same
level and on one of the two end tiles (face) as the apex tile (edge) is
under attack by the pawn's bead capture. Blocking is not a problem.

To capture a pawn in 3D requires only that its current position be under
attack, that it is the attacker's move, and that capture does not result
in check. Of course, a bishop can only attack half the tiles on the
board, and the duke only a quarter, but that is just an extension of the
2D restrictions. Capture is not a problem.

The problem is creating a fence. In 2D a pawn has only *one* tile to
which it can advance, and any one piece can threaten one tile. The
bishop can only threaten every other tile down the 2D pawn's file, and
the knight may have to jockey for position, but with a little advance
planning both can threaten the progress of the pawn. In contrast, in 3D,
the pawn has *three* tiles it can advance to, none of which are of the
same duke color, and not all of which are of the same bishop color.
Therefore, neither the knight, bishop, nor duke can fence a pawn; that
requires a rook, or queen, or...stack.[^53] Even the king can fence the
pawn if it gets in front of it before the 7^th^ rank.

Two pieces can fence a pawn in principle, but in practice, setting up
two pieces generally gives the pawn enough time to dodge the fence
before it is complete.

For unshackled pawns, blocking is only fully effective on the same
level, and one has to watch out for the long-range attacks, both
bishop-like reduced attacks, and the duke-like duplex attacks that
become enabled once a pawn has reached a back plane. There is nothing
unique about capturing unshackled pawns. Fencing, however, no longer
applies as an unshackled pawn has its limited range restriction lifted.

The result of these differences is that pawn races in 3D have conflicted
similarities and divergences with their 2D equivalents.

#### Pawn Races[]{.indexref entry="Pawn Races:Endgames where a pawn must beat another piece to a promotion tile."} King[]{.indexref entry="Endgame:Simple scenarios near the end of the game where mate is achieved."}

This endgame has two variations; one where the White king can engage and
one where it cannot. Only the latter case will be considered here. In
2D, White can successfully promote only if the Black king is far enough
away. If it is within the *6x6 square* of tiles anchored by the
promotion tile, then the pawn is doomed. It is the same in 3D; if the
Black king is within the *6x6x6 cube* of tiles anchored by the promotion
tile, then the pawn is doomed. Outside of those 36, or 216 tiles, White
wins.

The ratios of initial positions which yield a draw are surprisingly
close; in 2D, 36/64 = 56%, in 3D, 216/512 = 42%. White's race is
slightly easier in 3D.

Figure 190 shows an example where the Black king is just barely close
enough (KB6,6) to thwart White and eke out a draw. Note, that the pawn
cannot race to a back plane any faster than it can advance down the
diagonal of its level, so the strategy of becoming unshackled does not
upset this endgame unless the Black king was already on (or very near)
to one of the back planes. The unshackled case would make a good chess
puzzle as there are only a few initial positions where it is a threat.

Like the queen endgame, this one works out essentially the same, but
likewise also improves White's dominance, although less dramatically.

#### Pawn Races[]{.indexref entry="Pawn Races:Endgames where a pawn must beat another piece to a promotion tile."} Knight[]{.indexref entry="Endgame:Simple scenarios near the end of the game where mate is achieved."}

In 2D, White generally loses this race. The endgame starts with a race
between the knight and pawn both headed toward the promotion tile. When
the knight gets near the pawn, he can either fence or block it from
advancing. Now it is a kings' race. If the Black king arrives first,
it's a draw. If the White king arrives first, the knight can generally
alternate between checking the king and either fencing or blocking the
pawn in perpetuity, also a draw.

While the knight is faster than the pawn, it has further to go, and
changes color with every move (also duke color in 3D). This implies a
phase angle associated with the knight; 180Â° in 2D, 90Â° in 3D. It is
thus twice as hard to arrive in the vicinity of the promotion tile with
the right phase.

There are several edge cases where White can prevail, but as a
percentage of the total number of random initial positions, they are
pretty sparse. The most revealing edge case has the knight initially on
the corner tile diagonally (2D) or super-diagonally (3D) opposed to the
promotion tile of a previously unmoved (or only singly advanced) pawn.

![[]{#_Ref76376439 .anchor}Figure 190: Endgame -- Pawn Races[]{.indexref
entry="Pawn Races:Endgames where a pawn must beat another piece to a promotion tile."}
King](media/image191.png){alt="A picture containing background pattern Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="7.553472222222222in"}

In a pawn-king race where the pawn's king is too far away to engage (Q1,
Q1,1), the opposing king can thwart the promotion of a virgin pawn on a
rook file (QR2, QR2,2) if it is within the 6x6 square of tiles (a) or
6x6x6 cube of tiles (b) anchored by the promotion tile (QR8, or QR8,8).
Ghost pieces show the moves; White to move first. The pawn can promote
but is immediately captured.

In 2D, White prevails (if the Black knight cannot check the White king
enroute to the pawn), but in 3D, because of the finer resolution of the
3D board, the knight can block the pawn from promotion, an option not
available in the 2D version, changing this endgame into a kings' race.
Alas, almost none of this matters in 3D, for neither the knight, bishop,
nor duke can fence a pawn; that requires a rook, or queen, ...or
stack.[^54]

In 2D a pawn has only one tile to which it can advance, and any one
piece can threaten one tile. Even the king can fence the pawn if it gets
in front of it before the 7^th^ rank. The bishop can only threaten every
other tile down the 2D's pawn's file, and the knight may have to jockey
for position, but with a little advance planning both can threaten the
progress of the pawn.

In 3D, the pawn's regular advance covers two bishop colors and three
duke colors, so neither a single bishop, nor single knight, nor a single
duke (not even the pair) can fence a pawn. However, they can reduce its
options and they can often delay promotion; both have tactical value.
Both bishop and knight can limit the pawn at least once to its apex
tile, (slows progress toward the back planes, obstructing unshackling),
or deny access to its apex tile (delaying promotion).

Figure 191 shows this edge case out 4 moves. In 2D, the knight is too
late to prevent a successful promotion, but had the knight started on
any other tile it would have been able to capture, fence, or block the
pawn. In 3D, the knight has more options, and Black will be able to
block the pawn converting it into a kings' race. He will not, however,
be able to fence the pawn.

The relevant tiles have been raised to reveal their duke colors. Note,
how the knight's moves change both bishop and duke colors. To avoid
clutter, only one set of yellow decorators are on the board, centered on
the knight's second move for maximum clarity.

If Black blindly follows the 2D algorithm, not only can he not block the
pawn, but he could also even lose his knight (the silver tile, QN1,1
from Black's perspective). However, if his third move is to the gold
tile on the QB level rather than the ruby tile on the Q level, then he
can play to either the ruby or jade tile on the QR level and thus block
the pawn's advance. Even if White advances her pawn to an end tile on
any earlier move, heading toward a back plane. she cannot prevail, for
this extends the number of moves required to promote by one, giving
Black time to reposition his knight to block the pawn's advance.

For instance, if White advances her pawn on the fourth move to QR7,6,
instead of QR7,7, then Black simply leaves his knight on the gold tile
(QB3,3) and moves his king. If the pawn tries advancing to the left back
plane, the knight lites upon the ruby tile blocking the move. If the
pawn next makes an apex advance (that's the ruby tile from before), the
knight simply captures it. If instead the pawn advances to the right end
tile (the original apex tile) the knight advances to either the ruby or
jade tile, resulting in the same position, but with the Black king
closer to the action. The right back plane is just a mirror image of the
left, so the same analysis applies for that case.

![[]{#_Ref76386618 .anchor}Figure 191: Endgame -- Pawn Races[]{.indexref
entry="Pawn Races:Endgames where a pawn must beat another piece to a promotion tile."}
Knight](media/image192.png){alt="A picture containing shape Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="7.553472222222222in"}

In 2D White loses this race unless the Black knight is diagonally
opposed to the promotion tile (a). In 3D, White can at best convert this
edge case (super diagonal) into a king's race (b). If the knight's third
move is to the ruby tile instead of the gold one, his advance to the
silver tile will get him captured. From the gold tile, Black can block
White even if the pawn reaches a back plane.

In 2D, a knight can be attacked by a king as either a rook or bishop.
The knight can check the king in *two* moves from a rook attack, and in
just *one* move from a bishop attack. It is possible for a lone knight
to stave off pawn promotion indefinitely even when the pawn's king is
engaged. The algorithm is to alternate between blocking the pawn,
checking the king, and fencing the pawn.

In 3D, a knight can be attacked by a king as either a rook, a bishop, or
a duke. Check can be done in *four* moves from a rook attack, in *two*
moves from a bishop attack, and *three* moves from a duke attack, but
there is no pattern where a knight under attack by a king can fork its
attacker in one move. It is no longer possible for a lone knight to
stave off pawn promotion once the pawn's king engages because he can
only block the pawn, not fence it, and it takes too many moves to check
the king. The pawn escapes and promotes.

If the knight is no longer a serious threat, then this endgame converts
to a kings' race. Given a random initial position, in 2D this endgame
goes to Black (draw) about 99% of the time; in 3D it only goes to Black
about 60% of the time. Again, the pawn has slightly better odds in 3D.

#### Pawn Races[]{.indexref entry="Pawn Races:Endgames where a pawn must beat another piece to a promotion tile."} Bishop

Like the pawn/knight race, there are almost zero initial positions in 2D
where White prevails. However, since the bishop cannot fence the pawn in
3D either, this endgame also converts to a kings' race and Black can
only force a draw about 60% of the time.

#### Pawn Races[]{.indexref entry="Pawn Races:Endgames where a pawn must beat another piece to a promotion tile."} Duke

The duke has all the same problems of the bishop in 3D in addition to
not being able to reach Â¾ of the tiles on the board. However, all the
promotion tiles are metallic, so like the bishop the duke can reach Â½
the promotion tiles. Like the bishop, the duke cannot fence the pawn, so
again this endgame converts to a kings' race and Black can force a draw
about 60% of the time.

#### Pawn Races[]{.indexref entry="Pawn Races:Endgames where a pawn must beat another piece to a promotion tile."} Stack

Unique amongst the lower 3D pieces, the stack has positions from which
it can fence the pawn. The best comparison is with the 2D bishop. When
the bishop fences a pawn, White's only option is to use her king to
threaten it, but the bishop just slides along whatever diagonal was
fencing the pawn forcing the king to waste moves to give chase. This
allows Black to engage his king.

Given the stack's few and highly dispersed overlap tiles, the slide
option is only occasionally available, as it requires two overlap tiles
to be on the board. However, for a pawn on a rook level there are indeed
two overlap tiles on the board for many of the potential pawn locations
which allow the stack to evade the White king while maintaining the
fence.

Figure 192 shows the situation where the white-silver stack advanced to
Q3,3, fencing the QR pawn after its double advance to QR4,4. It takes
the White king three moves to approach, and when it does the stack
retreats to KR1,1 (the other overlap tile, Feynman in this case). The
stack simply oscillates back and forth between the pair of overlap tiles
until his king can take the pawn. (Remember *overlap shells*?)

![[]{#_Ref76465216 .anchor}Figure 192: Endgame -- Pawn Races[]{.indexref
entry="Pawn Races:Endgames where a pawn must beat another piece to a promotion tile."}
Stack](media/image193.png){alt="Diagram Description automatically generated with medium confidence"
width="6.5in" height="6.69375in"}

A stack can effectively fence a pawn, as a stack, if it has two overlap
tiles on the board. In this case Q3,3, and KR1,1 both fence a pawn on
the QR level after it has made a double advance. It takes the White king
three moves to switch which overlap tile it threatens, giving Black the
opportunity to chase down and capture the defenseless and immobile pawn
(ghost kings). Result of this endgame is a draw when there are two
overlap tiles on the board. Decorators for the stack on KR1,1 are not
shown, but overlap with those from Q3,3 maintaining the fence on the QR
pawn.

With rare exceptions this endgame goes Black's way, and he can eke out a
draw.

When there aren't a suitable pair of overlap tiles on the board, the
stack always has the option to decay into its separate sub-pieces each
of which can retreat to distant parts of the board preventing the White
king from breaking the fence while providing the Black king the time to
capture the pawn.

The "pawn races stack" endgame is typically short lived, quite literally
decaying into a pawn races bishop & duke endgame.

#### Pawn Races[]{.indexref entry="Pawn Races:Endgames where a pawn must beat another piece to a promotion tile."} Bishop & Duke

While a bishop and a duke have more degrees of freedom to establish a
fence than the stack does, it takes two moves to do so giving the pawn
time to dodge the fence. This typically also converts to a kings' race,
but the bishop and duke can corral the pawn more effectively driving it
preferentially toward the Black king. Best guess is that Black can eke
out a draw about 70% of the time.

#### Unshackled Pawn Races[]{.indexref entry="Pawn Races:Endgames where a pawn must beat another piece to a promotion tile."}

A pawn which reaches a back plane and becomes unshackled cannot be
fenced for the same reasons; multiple possible destination tiles of
different colors, but it can be blocked. However, if it is fewer moves
from promotion by a back plane than by its horizontal level, it can win
many of the races just covered.

Figure 193 shows a pawn on QR5,3. White has invested two or three moves
in this pawn, but on the horizontal level it is no closer to promotion
than from its original position (5 moves). It is, however, only 4 moves
from promotion via the left back plane. The Black knight cannot reach it
in time if it goes this way. Once there, it also has as options 6
promotion tiles, all of course, metallic.

The primary calculus in pawn endgames is how many moves to promotion,
and the shortest one, whether level or back plane, is usually the
critical number.

![[]{#_Ref76483837 .anchor}Figure 193: Endgame -- Unshackled Pawn
Races[]{.indexref
entry="Pawn Races:Endgames where a pawn must beat another piece to a promotion tile."}](media/image194.png){alt="Diagram Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="6.402777777777778in"}

The QR pawn is 5 moves from promotion via its level, but only 4 via its
closest back plane. It can win the race in this direction; the knight
can threaten it, but not in time. From the back plane, the pawn
immediately advances like a regular rook to any of 6 promotion tiles,
all metallic. They are raised to reveal their duke colors. Ghost pieces
show the sequence of moves. If the pawn ends up on the QB level (shown),
and promotes to a queen, it attacks the knight as a rook and checks the
king as a duke.

#### Pawn Race Summary

One of the critical criteria for *feels like chess,* is that a one pawn
advantage should typically win the game. A pawn is a bit more of an
advantage in 3D than in 2D. This is despite that pawn power projection
is lower than in 2D, even with the predator, bead, and dart capture
tiles. This is due in part to the power projection of the knight being
even lower (see Table 13), but also because neither bishop nor knight
can individually fence a pawn anymore, yet neither can the duke. While
the edge cases diverge less, these endgames have shifted toward the
player with the extra pawn.

In comparison to 2D, a pawn is as strong against a king, stronger
against either knight or bishop, a lot stronger against a duke (compared
to a 2D bishop), and possibly a little stronger against a stack. All in
all, very comparable, despite a radical change in the nature of the very
definition of 'move'; planar moves with advancement squares have yielded
similar play in the endgame.

### Bishop, Duke, Knight etc.

In 2D, it is possible, but hard, for a bishop and a knight to checkmate
a lone king. It takes up to 30 moves. It is not known if this endgame
results in mate in 3D, but the suspicion is that it fails; the knight
has a very low PPR[]{.indexref
entry="PPR:Power projection ratio, portion of the board reachable in 1 move."}
and takes 5 steps to move from one tile to one orthogonally adjacent,
while in 2D it takes only 3.

Given that both the bishop and the duke inherit some of the 2D bishop
nature, it is more likely that it requires all three pieces, but again,
the outcome of this endgame is unknown. While also unknown, it is almost
certain that a duke and knight cannot checkmate a lone king.

A necessary, but insufficient condition, is that there exists a
checkmate position; without one, mate is clearly impossible. The
difficulty of a mate usually depends on where on the board the opposing
king is, corner, edge, face, or open. The queen is the only piece that
can checkmate the king in the open. For all the other endgames, the
opposing king must be confined up against the side of the board.

It does not matter what face, nor what edge, but it can matter what
corner. Four of the corners are white, four black. If a bishop is one of
the attacking pieces, then which corner the king is in determines either
the outcome, or at least which mate algorithm is required.

For dukes, the corners divide into even more groups, three. Half the
corners are in gem planes, so the duke may help confine, but it won't be
the checking piece. For the other four, half are gold tiles and half are
silver tiles. If the king is not on the duke color, the duke can only
assist.

A detailed analysis of these variations awaits better software support.

Figure 194 shows one checkmate position with just a bishop, knight and
king, there are several. Forcing this outcome, however, is another
matter. Also note that the king is in a corner of the board where the
corner tile is of the same color as the bishop. The situation is
trickier when the king is one of the four corners which are of the
opposite color to the bishop.

![[]{#_Ref76485548 .anchor}Figure 194: Endgame -- A Bishop & Knight
Checkmate
Position](media/image195.png){alt="Background pattern Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="6.402777777777778in"}

While it is possible (barely) for a bishop and a knight to mate a lone
king in 2D, the algorithm is torturous and can take up to 30 moves. It
is not known if there is a general mate algorithm for this endgame in
3D, but the suspicion is that there is not. A necessary but not
sufficient condition is that checkmate positions exist, such as this
one.

If there is a 3D mate algorithm it likely will require more than 30
moves. If so, this puts upward pressure on the 2D balance rule that 50
moves without a capture or pawn advance results in a draw. For 3D, this
move limit should probably be raised, but how far is uncertain.

### Review

In comparison to 2D, White is stronger with a queen, as strong with one
rook or two, weaker with dual bishops, as strong or stronger with a pawn
against just one other piece or against one bishop and other minor
pieces.

There are three major differences with 2D endgames; the queen can mate
without the assistance of her king and in the open, the dual bishop mate
is harder and maybe not achievable from all random positions, and the
pawn races tend to favor the pawn.

However, it is the similarities that are striking; a one pawn advantage
typically wins, the rook endgames have identical algorithms, and the
other endgames have similar algorithms with similar outcomes. It still
*feels like chess.*

So far so good.

## Midgame {#midgame-1}

The midgame generally starts after castling and ends when there are few
enough pieces that established algorithms exist for a deterministic
conclusion to the game. The complexity of the midgame is, in 2D, quite
literally astronomical. In 3D, it is far beyond that. The key concept in
both realms is the []{#gambit .anchor}*gambit*[]{.indexref
entry="gambit:Standard sequence of moves with a well establish purpose or outcome."}.

A gambit[]{.indexref
entry="gambit:Standard sequence of moves with a well establish purpose or outcome."}
may be a short exchange of material; as in PxN, BxP, RxB, or a jockeying
for position; using cover to establish flexibility, security, or threat.
When applied to named openings, the word gambit generally implies
sacrificing a piece (typically a pawn) in exchange for the initiative or
for a positional advantage. As applied to the midgame, a gambit will
have a descriptive name, a canonical pattern suggestive of its core
attributes, as well as a context which extols its virtues and reveals
its weaknesses

In either context, a gambit[]{.indexref
entry="gambit:Standard sequence of moves with a well establish purpose or outcome."}
is a way of []{#chunking .anchor}*chunking*[]{.indexref
entry="chunking:Reducing complexity via pattern of moves, or architecture of position."},
reducing complexity with either a pattern of moves, or an architecture
of position.

There are 3D equivalents to most 2D midgame gambits, but the focus of
this chapter will be on the gambits that are new to 3D, the ones that
have no analogs in 2D.

### Piece Values

Before we begin however, we need to develop a rule of thumb about the
value of the pieces. If we are considering trading a rook for a stack,
will we be ahead or behind after the exchange? The value of 2D chess
pieces have been gleaned from countless hours of play. The pawn is
assigned the arbitrary value of 1; the rest of the values are intended
as a guide for evaluation of the favorability of a potential exchange.

Based on the endgames just studied, we can make educated guesses about
the value of 3D pieces. These are presented alongside their 2D values in
the table below with commentary to follow.

  -----------------------------------------
  Piece                2D           3D
  --------------- ------------ ------------
  Pawn                 1            1

  Duke               \-\--          2

  Knight               2Â½           3

  Bishop               3            4

  Stack              \-\--          6

  Rook                 5            8

  Queen                9            15
  -----------------------------------------

  : []{#_Toc210218562 .anchor}Table 14: **Relative Piece Values in 2D
  and 3D Chess**

In both realms the pawn is assigned the unit value, 1. The duke can get
to a quarter of the tiles on the board, the bishop half, and the rook
all; so, the value pattern 2, 4, 8 is suggested. The bishop and duke are
long range pieces and blockable; while the knight has limited range, it
is not blockable, can reach all the tiles on the board (eventually), and
is the only piece which can attack the queen without being
counterattacked in return. We give it a value of 3, between duke and
bishop, and just a bit less than its relative value in 2D compared with
the bishop. The stack is just the sum of the duke & bishop at 6. In 2D,
the queen is one more than the sum of the base pieces, so we do likewise
in 3D, at a staggering 15. A rook and a bishop sum only to twelve, but a
rook and a stack sum to 14, one less than the queen.

It is likely these values will change as experience improves, but it's a
good first start.

### The Slingshot Gambit

The *slingshot gambit* is where a pawn captures to a sling tile, then on
the next move or later makes a second sling capture. If the captures are
in *opposite* directions, this will return the pawn to the original
major plane. When preceded by a double advance to the apex tile, this
leaves the pawn just one move away from promotion, potentially on the
same level it started on.

If the captures are in the *same* direction, this will advance the pawn
toward the back plane in that direction. If the pawn made a double
advance, and either it was to the apex tile, or the captures are toward
the closer back plane, this slingshot leaves the pawn on the back plane
and thus, again, just one move away from promotion, but this time two
levels away from where it started.

In both cases, White made only *two* moves, but it placed the pawn
*three* moves closer to promotion.

This generally puts the opponent in a bind; they must either trade
material for a lousy pawn, or deal with a pawn about to be promoted. The
first loses material, the second loses initiative.

Another variation on the slingshot gambit is to capture to sling tiles
in *different* outward planes. In this case, moving in *opposite*
directions places the pawn on the back plane on the original level (and
thus one move away from promotion, while captures in the *same*
direction leave the pawn one move from promotion two levels away.

Figure 195 shows an example of two White pawns making slingshot gambits
in the same outward plane (rightward)

On the king side, the pawn makes a double advance, then captures the
Black pawn on the up sling tile of the rightward plane (taking him out
of the primary plane), followed by a capture of the knight on the down
sling tile of the rightward plane (restoring him to the primary plane)
and thus just one move away from promotion.

On the queen side, the pawn makes a double advance, then captures the
Black pawn on the down sling tile of the rightward plane (taking him out
of the primary plane), followed by a capture of the stack on the down
sling tile of the rightward plane (placing him two slices away from the
primary plane, but also placing him on the left back plane), again just
one move away from promotion (if unblocked).

Red decorators show the double advances, green decorators show the pair
of slingshot captures.

![[]{#_Ref76540305 .anchor}Figure 195: Midgame -- Slingshot
Gambit](media/image196.png){alt="Shape Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="7.276388888888889in"}

Two White pawns make double advances. King-side pawn captures the Black
pawn on the up sling tile in one direction, the knight on the down sling
tile in the *other* direction, placing it one move from promotion (a).
Queen-side pawn captures the Black pawn on the down sling tile in one
direction, the stack on the down sling tile in the *same* direction,
placing it on the left back plane, again one move from promotion (b).
Ghost pawns show advances, green outlines captured pieces.

### Trapdoor Gambits

Trapdoor gambits are all based on a particular piece being unable to
immediately retreat to its previous position.

#### Trapdoor Gambit

Consider a situation where your opponent can threaten two of your pieces
but not at the same time, and where you can defend each piece but not
from the same position. When your opponent moves to threaten the other
piece, you move to defend, and if they move back to threaten the
previous piece, you follow suite. This is a classic dynamic defense; if
they do this, you do that; if they do that, you do this.

This is where the trapdoor shifts from an interesting anomaly of 3D
chess into a gambit; one side may be able to interrupt this
back-and-forth dance to their benefit.

The next two figures show such a situation, but one on steroids, for in
this (admittedly contrived) situation, the back-and-forth dance can be
stopped on *either* beat; the trapdoor is bidirectional.

Figure 196 shows the setup. There is one Black rook on the queen level
shown as two ghost pieces which indicate the two positions this single
rook can oscillate between, advancing and retreating in the horizontal
plane (decorators not shown). In each position it defends one of Black's
bishops. From Q7,2 (partially obscured by the king level) it is covering
the king side white bishop on KR7,5 via 5x5 advancement square in a left
vertical plane. From Q2,6 it is threatening the queen side black bishop
on QB2,8 via 3x3 advancement square also in a left vertical plane. The
red rook decorators are shown for these two covers.

White is attacking these two bishops with her silver duke (also shown as
a pair of ghost pieces) which oscillates up and down in the 2,2 column
in sync with the rook's threat. Note that both bishops are on silver
tiles, which have been slightly raised to show their duke color. Her
oscillation occurs in the minor plane; attack of the king side bishop
occurs in the upright plane via 2x2 advancement square, and her attack
of the queen side bishop occurs in the downright plane via 4x4
advancement square. Some duke tiles off the board have been decorated,
some not, striving for clarity while also managing figure size.

The rook does not have a lot of choice here in how to defend either
bishop; most options are either blocked or threatened by other pieces.
Indeed, many of White's pieces are attacking the center of the queen
level; three pawns (don't forget predator tiles), both knights, the
developed rook, and the gold duke.

Figure 197 shows how White can use her pair of knights on the king
bishop level to set a trapdoor in either direction. Yellow decorators
are for one knight, the slimy green decorators for the other. One of the
rook oscillation advancement squares is shown, clearly indicating that
the yellow knight blocks its immediate return. By symmetry, the slimy
green knight does the same thing in the other direction.

![[]{#_Ref76638466 .anchor}Figure 196: Midgame -- Dynamic Trapdoor
Gambit
Setup](media/image197.png){alt="Shape Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="7.3590277777777775in"}

Black's rook on the queen level can oscillate between two tiles
defending either of his bishops (ghost rooks). White can attack each
bishop by similarly oscillating his silver duke in the 2,2. column
(ghost dukes). The duke's oscillation is from apex to apex, so is not
vulnerable to a trapdoor, but the rook's oscillation is not between apex
tiles, so a piece injected into the queen level in just the right way
can establish a trapdoor, in this case, in either direction.

![[]{#_Ref76638478 .anchor}Figure 197: Midgame -- Dynamic Trapdoor
Gambit
Tripped](media/image198.png){alt="Shape Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="7.290277777777778in"}

White can set up a trapdoor in either direction by moving one knight or
the other onto the perimeter of either advancing or retreating
advancement squares. Ghost knights show the two possible moves. Red
decorators show just one of the rook advancement squares. Knight tiles
downward are shown in yellow for one knight and in a slimy green color
for the other.

The knights are exposed to a rook attack when they invade the queen
level. However, the yellow knight next to the gold duke cannot be
captured by the Black rook when on Q2,6 as it is blocked by that duke,
and if taken when the Black rook is on Q7,2, the king can capture it; an
exchange which White wins. The slimy green knight can be captured when
the Black rook is in either position, but the White rook will capture
it; again, an exchange that White wins.

Now for the trap. White moves her duke to attack the other bishop, and
Black moves his rook to defend. White moves her duke back re-attacking
the first bishop, but Black cannot fully retreat his rook, so bishop is
undefended. In this example, either bishop becomes vulnerable, it just
depends on which knight invades the queen level.

#### Trapdoor Chain

A []{#trapdoor_chain .anchor}*trapdoor chain*[]{.indexref
entry="trapdoor chain:A trapdoor requiring more than 2 steps for a retreat to the original tile."}
is whenever an advance requires *more than two moves* to retreat back to
the original tile.

Formally, a trapdoor is any move that requires more than one step to
retreat in the *same plane and* in the *same quadrant* as the advance.
Typically, this is just two moves, but it can be more. The maximum
number of steps to retreat is limited by the perimeter; thus, an advance
to perimeter 4 won't require more than 4 steps to return. A retreat that
requires 3 moves has a chain length of 3. A trapdoor chain[]{.indexref
entry="trapdoor chain:A trapdoor requiring more than 2 steps for a retreat to the original tile."}
of maximum length will be referred to as a []{#trapdoor_hallway
.anchor}*trapdoor hallway*[]{.indexref
entry="trapdoor hallway:A trapdoor chain of maximum length, the advance perimeter number."}
-- make of that name what you will.[^55]

A []{#trapdoor_shortcut .anchor}*trapdoor shortcut*[]{.indexref
entry="trapdoor shortcut:An out of plane or quadrant retreat shorter than the chain length."}
is any path that uses either different quadrants or different planes to
execute a faster retreat than can be achieved when restricted to the
advance plane and quadrant.

Figure 198 shows the advance and retreat snapshots of a trapdoor
chain[]{.indexref
entry="trapdoor chain:A trapdoor requiring more than 2 steps for a retreat to the original tile."}
of maximum length; a trapdoor hallway[]{.indexref
entry="trapdoor hallway:A trapdoor chain of maximum length, the advance perimeter number."}.
The rook has advanced to perimeter 4 in the horizontal level, but the
two unfortunately placed pawns limit each of the rook's retreat steps to
perimeter 1 advances. It thus takes *four* moves to retreat in the same
plane and quadrant. White should be looking for a shortcut.

With just the horizontal snapshots, there is not enough information to
know if White has a shortcut which uses a vertical plane, but it's
likely the rook can return that way in 3 or even 2 moves depending on
the locations of other pieces.

However, White has a shortcut in this very plane; she just must be
willing to retreat in a different quadrant.

Figure 199 shows this three move in-plane shortcut as a series of
snapshots.

![[]{#_Ref76646290 .anchor}Figure 198: Midgame -- Trapdoor Chain of
Maximum Length, a Trapdoor
Hallway](media/image199.png){alt="Diagram Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="6.416666666666667in"}

A trapdoor move is any move (a) that requires more than one move to
retreat to the original tile, but it can take more. In this example it
takes *four* moves for the rook to return (b), (c), (d), (e); a trapdoor
chain[]{.indexref
entry="trapdoor chain:A trapdoor requiring more than 2 steps for a retreat to the original tile."}
of length 4, which is also the maximum possible for an initial advance
to perimeter 4, so this is also a trapdoor hallway[]{.indexref
entry="trapdoor hallway:A trapdoor chain of maximum length, the advance perimeter number."}.

When a linear move is constrained to one plane only, as in the
presumption above, it is much more susceptible to being blocked. That
pesky forward pawn has put a lot of []{#friction
.anchor}*friction*[]{.indexref
entry="friction:Any arrangement which requires multiple steps for a piece to advance."}
on the rook's retreat.

![[]{#_Ref76646299 .anchor}Figure 199: Midgame -- Trapdoor Shortcut
(In-plane)](media/image200.png){alt="A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated with medium confidence"
width="6.5in" height="5.097222222222222in"}

By retreating in multiple quadrants, the rook can retreat to the
original tile in just three moves; a trapdoor shortcut[]{.indexref
entry="trapdoor shortcut:An out of plane or quadrant retreat shorter than the chain length."}.

While it is conceptually awkward to think of a move as not having a
trajectory, it is this very property that allows for multiple return
paths all in the same plane.

### Multifunction Gambits

In 2D chess, most moves are single function; the move either blocks one
attack, defends one friend, or attacks one foe. The exciting moves are
those that are multi-functional, like a fork.

In 3D, in contrast, most moves are multi-functional; and if you're not
paying attention, inadvertently to your sorrow. Making a multi-function
move complicates your opponent's situation; increasing their
computational load on analyzing your move, rather than on trying to see
three moves ahead on their agenda. If they miss one of the functions,
the response will likely leave them vulnerable to that overlooked
function, and there is your competitive advantage. The more functions,
the more chances to overlook one.

Figure 200 shows a lowly pawn making a multifunction move. Over the next
few figures, we'll investigate this deceptively simple looking regular
advance.

![[]{#_Ref76805038 .anchor}Figure 200: Midgame -- Pawn Multifunction
Advance](media/image201.png){alt="A picture containing shape Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="7.276388888888889in"}

White pawn makes a regular advance on the KB level to an end tile
returning it to the primary plane. Ghost pawn shows the move.

Figure 201 shows the pawn now blocks the attack of the Black duke on the
White duke, but it was previously a mutual attack, so the pawn has
reduced this to a peeking situation.

![[]{#_Ref76805051 .anchor}Figure 201: Midgame -- Pawn Reduces a Mutual
Attack to a Peeking
Attack](media/image202.png){alt="Shape Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="7.276388888888889in"}

Pawn converts the silver duke mutual attack into a peeking situation;
note the 3 dimmed blue decorators which are part of White's
counterattack advancement square.

Figure 202 shows the obvious stuff; the pawn in now covering two of his
own pawns (both predator tiles) but is also forking two of Black's pawns
plus his rook.

![[]{#_Ref76806241 .anchor}Figure 202: Midgame -- Pawn Dual Cover and
Triple
Fork](media/image203.png){alt="A picture containing diagram Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="7.276388888888889in"}

Pawn covers two of his own pawns, both on predator tiles, and forks two
of Black's pawns, both on sling tiles, along with his rook via direct
duke attack, a double cover, and a triple fork.

Figure 203 shows the pawn has freed the knight from being pinned against
queen, liberating it to have an effective attack on the queen pawn.

![[]{#_Ref76806223 .anchor}Figure 203: Midgame -- Pawn Frees Knight from
Queen
Pin](media/image204.png){alt="Diagram Description automatically generated with medium confidence"
width="6.5in" height="7.276388888888889in"}

Previously, the knight was pinned against the queen by the rook attack.
The pawn's advance creates a 3-way mutual block freeing the knight to
attack the queen level pawn.

Figure 204 shows how the pawn's simple advance thwarts Black's
prevention of White castling on the king side by blocking the bishop's
attack on the 'pass through check tile.'

Black's white bishop was preventing White from a king-side castle by the
'can't move through check restriction.' The pawn now blocks this block.

Figure 205 shows the pawn escapes the queen's attack, discovers the
bishop *and* the rook back onto her (a two-piece quark attack) but also
pins her against her king by *both* bishop and rook!

![[]{#_Ref76808146 .anchor}Figure 205: Midgame -- Pawn Escapes Queen,
Discovers Quark and Double
Pin](media/image206.png){alt="Shape, arrow Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="7.276388888888889in"}

To cap it all off, the pawn escapes the queen's attack, simultaneously
discovers a quark attack by bishop and rook, which also pins her against
her king by both pieces, a double pin.

The pawn has achieved the following functions.

1.  Converted a mutual attack into a one-way attack by peeking (no
    analog in 2D)

2.  Covered two pieces

3.  Forked three pieces (max of 2 in 2D)

4.  Unpinned a piece allowing it to threaten another

5.  Blocked a 'pass through check' block permitting castling

6.  Escaped an attack

7.  Discovered a quark attack (no analog in 2D)

8.  Discovered a double pin (no analog in 2D)

While this example is a little over the top, it displays the propensity
in 3D chess for multi-function gambits and demonstrates just how complex
they can become. While looking several moves ahead is still important, a
player must avoid trading analysis of the present for future ambitions.

### Capturing Half a Piece

Capturing half a piece -- how is that even possible? In 2D, it's not,
but in 3D there is one composite piece, the stack. The
[]{#stack_split_gambit .anchor}*stack split gambit*[]{.indexref
entry="stack split gambit:Forcing a stack to split so one sub-piece can be captured."}
is a strategy for forcing the stack to decay so that one sub-piece can
be captured. A trapdoor is the typical method.

Recall the definition of a trapdoor move; a piece which advances to a
between tile has a *retreat*[]{.indexref
entry="retreat:Returning to the original tile after an advance."}
advancement square that doesn\'t fully overlay the *forward*
advancementÂ square. In addition, a bishop which advances to a linear
tile has a retreat[]{.indexref
entry="retreat:Returning to the original tile after an advance."}
advancement rectangle that doesn\'t fully overlay the forward
advancement rectangle either.

A stack advance to a q-tile does so with a duke apex move and a
linearÂ bishop move. The duke can retreat[]{.indexref
entry="retreat:Returning to the original tile after an advance."}, but
the bishop might not be able to. One stack goes out, only half a stack
comes back.

A stack advance to a Feynman tile does so with a bishop apex move and a
duke betweenÂ move. The bishop can retreat[]{.indexref
entry="retreat:Returning to the original tile after an advance."}, but
now it is the duke that might not be able to. One stack goes out, only
half a stack comes back.

Force the advance, force a []{#decay_retreat .anchor}*decay
retreat*[]{.indexref
entry="retreat:Returning to the original tile after an advance."},
capture the sub-piece left behind. That is how to capture half a stack.

Figure 206 shows a stack split gambit for an advance to a q-tile. The
current position of Black's white-silver duke on Q3,3 fences White's
queen bishop pawn, but Black sees an opportunity to check the White
king, and advances the stack to Q 7,7ch. White defends and counter
attacks with her bishop, forcing Black to retreat, but only the duke can
retreat; the bishop is blocked by the rooks. The queen-side rook blocks
both the advance and retreat advancement rectangles in Black's leftward
plane (dimmed decorators), the king-side rook only blocks the retreat
advancement square in the rightward plane (green decorators). The duke
is, however, defending the bishop, so the gambit generally has a 5-step
stanza; an advance, a threat, a decay retreat which splits the stack, a
capture of the orphaned sub-piece, and then a final revenge capture by
the other sub-piece.

![[]{#_Ref76980802 .anchor}Figure 206: Midgame -- Spilt Stack Gambit,
Q-tile](media/image207.png){alt="Shape, arrow Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="7.276388888888889in"}

To capture half a stack, force a decay split. Black was fencing QB pawn
but opts to check with his stack. White defends forcing Black to
retreat, but only the duke can retreat; the bishop's retreat is blocked
by the rooks (advancement regions are shown for the retreat only). BxB,
DxB, an even exchange but White's pawn is no longer fenced. Ghost pieces
(and sub-pieces) hint at the moves.

Similar situations exist for advances to Feynman tiles, but now it is
the duke that gets orphaned.

Figure 207 shows an example of the split stack gambit[]{.indexref
entry="stack gambit:Any gambit unique to the stack."} for a Feynman
tile. In this case the standard decorators show the forward advancement
squares, and the dimmed blue decorators show the duke retreat. Black is
desperate to castle. White has advanced her white-gold stack from QN3,3
to KB5,5 checking the king with the stack's duke attack, but also
preventing castling via the 'can't move through check rule' with the
stack's bishop attack on Blacks KB1,1 tile. Black responds creatively,
moving his knight to KB2,2 not only blocking the check but also blocking
the bishop's move through check attack. In addition, the knight move
discovers an attack on the stack, a true multi-function gambit. If White
choses to retreat, only the bishop can do so, leaving the duke
vulnerable. If Black takes the duke with his rook, White captures with
her bishop, but the knight still blocks the move through check threat
and Black can still castle king side, an option White lost earlier in
the game.

These are not necessarily great moves, but they show the essentials of
the gambit.

![[]{#_Ref76986254 .anchor}Figure 207: Midgame -- Spilt Stack Gambit,
Feynman
tile](media/image208.png){alt="Shape, arrow Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="7.276388888888889in"}

White advances her stack threatening the king by both direct check
(duke) and by blocking his castle (bishop). Black defends with a
multi-function move of his knight blocking both, but also discovering a
rook attack on the stack. White can only retreat the bishop. If RxD,
then BxR, but Black can still castle. Standard decorators are for the
forward advancement squares, dimmed blue ones for the duke retreat which
is blocked by the QN pawn. Ghost pieces hint at the moves.

### The Quark Gambit

Queens and stacks can attack a single piece as more than one base piece.
This is like a fork in that it generally takes more than one piece to
block the attack, but unlike a fork in that only one opposing piece is
under attack. This also apply describes the duke duplex attack.

Call any attack that can require more than one piece to block a
[]{#quark_gambit .anchor}*quark gambit*[]{.indexref
entry="quark gambit:Any move that places one piece under multiple attacks from one piece."}.
The closest analog in 2D is the []{#double_check .anchor}*double
check*[]{.indexref
entry="double check:A piece moves to check the king but also discovers a check."};
say a knight discovers a rook attack on the king, but also directly
checks the king as well.[^56]

A player's options are fourfold; move the threatened piece, capture the
attacker, block the attack, or at least cover the threatened piece. If
the piece is pinned it cannot be moved, if the attacking piece is out of
range or peeking it cannot be captured, if it is a quark attack it often
cannot be blocked with a single move, and coverage by the king is
thwarted in situations that would put it in check.

Figure 208 shows a situation where White is behind in material, but both
players still have their queens. If White could capture Black's queen,
it would be checkmate for the bishop would protect the queen, but the
move is blocked by the QN knight. Instead, she makes a q-tile quark
attack by moving to Q3,3. This threatens the Black queen as a rook, a
bishop (one plane only), and a duke, but in true multifunction style, it
both pins the queen to the king via rook and bishop moves, but also
discovers a pin of the queen to the king from White's white bishop on
the KN level. Black can block the duke attack with his QN pawn, but that
is insufficient. He cannot move his queen away as that discovers
multiple attacks on his king, one from the bishop and two more from the
queen. He cannot capture the queen for it is peeking out around the very
same bishop and that would place his king in check. He can advance the
queen only on the diagonal, but she will still be under multiple
attacks. Black could block all three quark attacks, and the bishop
attack as well, by moving his knight to Q4,4, and White cannot capture
it with her bishop because it is in a mutual block with the Black queen.
If the White queen captures the knight, it is no longer peeking out
around its bishop, so Black can take it with his queen; N\>Q4,4, QxN,
QxQ, BxQch.

The bishop takes the Black queen, forking the king and QN pawn. The king
can move to defend, and White should probably take the pawn bishop trade
for that puts the Black king far from his one remaining pawn, which
White's king is closer to, and her remaining pawn can block the Black
pawn's advance. If White can capture it before Black can defend it, and
the position looks promising, then it's the pawn-knight race and White
has at the very least been able torescue a draw out of the game; and
might very well win it.

![[]{#_Ref76996825 .anchor}Figure 208: Midgame -- Quark
Gambit](media/image209.png){alt="Shape, arrow Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="7.276388888888889in"}

White uses a queen quark attack to force a queen trade and gains a
knight and perhaps exchanges a bishop for a pawn, regaining material
parity. Since her king is closer to the only two remaining pawns she has
at least upgraded to a draw. Q\>Q3,3 discovering a pin on the queen and
quarking her. Black has no options for retreat or capture, and few
options to block, but moving either knight or queen to Q4,4 results in a
queen trade. Ghost pieces hint at the potential moves.

To a lesser degree, the stack and duke duplex moves are also quark
attacks, but so then is any linear move, for they occur in two plans at
once (three for the duke). Indeed, the queen's hotspot attack is just a
rook linear move combined with a duke duplex move for a four-way quark
attack.

### Doubled Pawn Gambits

In 2D chess, when two pawns end up on the same file, they are no good to
each other. Neither can protect the other, and the first one impedes the
progress of the second. This can be really good news for Black when he
is down material, for he can use his *one* pawn on that file to block
*two* opposing pawns.

In 3D chess, there are additional scenarios.

Figure 209 shows the four []{#doubled_pawn_gambits .anchor}*doubled pawn
gambits*[]{.indexref
entry="doubled pawn gambits:Any gambit involving two pawns on the same level."}
described below.

#### Texas Two-Step Gambit

Consider two pawns diagonally arranged on one level; the forward one
blocks the rearward one but is also protected by it from its bead
attack. In the []{#Texas_two_step_gambit .anchor}*Texas two-step
gambit*[]{.indexref
entry="Texas two-step gambit:Diagonal pawns advance such that rearward always covers forward."},
the forward pawn advances, now protected by the rearward's dart attack;
then the rearward one advances, again protecting the forward pawn by the
bead attack. While the rearward pawn remains vulnerable the forward pawn
is always covered (a).

#### Leapfrog Gambit

If two diagonally arranged pawns face a foe diagonally opposed to them,
either may capture; the forward one by bead, the rearward one by dart.
Generally, it is preferred to capture by dart as that advances a pawn
two moves closer to promotion. Call this the []{#leapfrog_gambit
.anchor}*leapfrog gambit*[]{.indexref
entry="leapfrog gambit:Pawns have rearward capture by dart rather than forward by bead."}
(b).

#### Pawn Escape Gambit

One opposing pawn may be able to stop two pawns on the same level (c),
or not (d). In the latter case we have the []{#pawn_escape_gambit
.anchor}*pawn escape gambit*[]{.indexref
entry="pawn escape gambit:Opposing pawn can only block one of a pair of doubled pawns."}.

#### Pawn Split Gambit

The pawn escape gambit[]{.indexref
entry="pawn escape gambit:Opposing pawn can only block one of a pair of doubled pawns."}
comes with a flip side. If it is White's turn, she can choose which pawn
blocks Black, and then try to promote the other. However, if it is
Black's turn, he gets to choose which pawn to block, but he may choose
instead to split them and try for promotion himself. This is the
[]{#pawn_split_gambit .anchor}*pawn split gambit*[]{.indexref
entry="pawn split gambit:Opposing pawn splits double pawns and heads for promotion."}.
This allows both White pawns to try for promotion, but now it is a race
(d).

When Black and White are equally far from promotion, who moves first
decides the game; except, White may be able to sacrifice a pawn in order
to tie this race. If Black promotes to a queen first, White's rearward
pawn blocks its rook attack on the forward pawn, and possibly its
bishop's attack, in which case both players end up with queens.

![[]{#_Ref77064548 .anchor}Figure 209: Midgame -- Four Double Pawn
Gambits](media/image210.png){alt="Shape Description automatically generated with medium confidence"
width="6.5in" height="7.276388888888889in"}

Two diagonally arranged pawns can advance so the rearward always covers
the forward (a). Capture by dart (44PxN) is preferred to capture by bead
(55PxN), as it advances two moves toward promotion (b). One opposing
pawn may be able to block both doubled pawns (c). If not, it can block
one, or split them and head for promotion itself (e). Ghost pawns show
the potential moves.

### King Checks King Gambit

The heritage of this gambit is peeking; formally it is a peeking
gambit[]{.indexref
entry="peeking gambit:A gambit where peeking is the fundamental element."},
but it is so unexpected that it deserves its own section. The retreat
advancement rectangle of a linear bishop move does not fully overlay the
forward advancement rectangle, even for a move to perimeter 1. This
stands in sharp contrast with the rook and duke linear moves; peeking is
not possible for their linear moves.

A king can make a bishop linear move to perimeter 1 in 12 different
directions. With the help of two other strategically placed pieces, a
king can therefore peek against any opposing piece with a bishop move --
including the opposing king.

The next four figures show the situation around the
[]{#king_checks_king_gambit .anchor}*king checks king
gambit*[]{.indexref
entry="king checks king gambit:One king checks another by peeking with its bishop linear move."};
Black to move. They are labeled as figures, but also as subfigures (a)
thru (d) to show they go together.

Figure 210 shows the setup with three decorator sets to indicate the
major threats and covers. Black is down in material but has three pawns
to White's one. If he can promote, he just might win. However, White has
him nicely fenced in by the rook, which the Black king is attacking, but
the KR pawn is defending it by its bishop predator attack. The White
rook is also attacking two of Black's pawns (one of which is defended by
the king), plus the knight. The White king is also threatening the
knight, but not the forward queen pawn as it is defended by the rearward
queen pawn via dart attack. The Black knight is attacking White's sole
pawn and if the White rook captures the pawn which is blocking its
advance, he'll have no choice but to capture it at the cost of his
knight. He might just capture it, anyway, planning to sacrifice the
knight in exchange to advance his remaining pawns closer to promotion.
But then he sees what looks like a golden opportunity.

Figure 211 shows Black's move of his rearward queen pawn. This is just
the Texas two-step gambit, he's still protecting the forward pawn, now
by bead attack instead of dart attack, but he has escaped the threat of
the rook. Even better, he has checked the White king via direct attack
and defended the knight from the rook as it is on a predator tile; a
solid multi-function gambit. However, he has so used up his degrees of
freedom that he is no longer attacking the two reduced tiles in the
upward direction. Note the close quarter decorators used to indicate
these two tiles are not covered. Two open diamonds indicate that capture
there is not possible in either plane. The White king is not prevented
from moving there by the pawn.

But doesn't this place him on a tile adjacent to the Black king? Indeed,
it does, and under normal circumstances that would be illegal for each
king would check the other. However, the same two pieces which prevent
the pawn from attacking this tile (the knight and forward pawn) also
prevent the Black king from advancing to this tile, but they do not
block White's check.

Figure 212 shows how the White king is peeking around the knight and
pawn to check the Black king, but the Black king is not counter checking
because each of the two Black pieces block one of the two bishop planes
needed for a linear advance. There is no analog of this in 2D chess. It
requires two additional pieces to enable this check (both bishop planes
must be blocked), but it is fully legal.

When one king peeks another, when it checks another king, the other king
generally has to retreat, unless it can likewise block the attack. The
result of that is *kissing kings*, and a lot of pinned pieces.

But in this case the situation is much worse.

Figure 213 shows just how bad. Black thought he had an escape for his
king down a level via duke linear move, but he does not. Being as fenced
in by the rook as if he were in the corner of the board, the White king
actually has him in checkmate; *checkmate by king*.

Wow!

![[]{#_Ref77088700 .anchor}Figure 210: Midgame -- King Checks King
Gambit
Setup](media/image211.png){alt="Diagram, shape, arrow Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="7.3590277777777775in"}

White's rook is a big threat, attacking 3 pieces, fencing the king and
protected by the KR pawn. The White king also threatens the knight, but
not the forward pawn as it is dart protected. Black needs to promote and
prevent White from doing the same, he might have to sacrifice his
knight, but then he sees a multi-function move with his rearward queen
pawn. Three decorator sets show the major interactions. Ghost pawn
indicates the next move.

![[]{#_Ref77088707 .anchor}Figure 211: Midgame -- King Checks King
Gambit Multi-function
Advance](media/image212.png){alt="Shape, arrow Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="7.3590277777777775in"}

Black advances his rearward pawn, evading the rook threat, defending his
knight (predator) and checking the White king (direct). He continues to
protect his forward pawn by bead attack, a classic Texas two-step
gambit, but fails to notice that he's saturated his pawn's degrees of
freedom and the White king is free to make a rook linear move to the
upper reduced tiles. Ghost king shows the move. But how is this legal,
he is on a tile adjacent to the Black king.

![[]{#_Ref77088715 .anchor}Figure 212: Midgame -- King Checks King
Gambit King Peeks at
King](media/image213.png){alt="Shape Description automatically generated with medium confidence"
width="6.5in" height="7.3590277777777775in"}

The White king is peeking out around the very same pieces that allowed
him access to the reduced tile. They block the Black king's
counterattack, but not White's forward attack. The White king is not in
check, but the Black king is, and by the White king himself. Recall that
the forward and retreat advancement rectangles of the bishop linear move
do not fully overlap; this is the king's only peeking move. Note the
king bishop linear decorators in both directions.

![[]{#_Ref77088729 .anchor}Figure 213: Midgame -- King Checks King
Gambit Checkmate by
King](media/image214.png){alt="Shape Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="7.276388888888889in"}

But it gets better. The Black king has nowhere to go, and no way to
block the opposing king's attack; he is in checkmate -- mated by the
White king.

### Survey of Gambits

Obviously, the number of potential 3D chess gambits is large, probably
one to two orders of magnitude larger than in 2D; books could be written
about them. Hopefully, the handful covered in detail above provides some
sense of their style and scale. Below are a few more gambits, but
without any figures, just a short description; think of them as
exercises.

#### Tangled Gambits

Everybody is covering everyone else. While cyclic attacks can be set up
in 2D, they are rare; not so in 3D. Indeed, it is possible to set up
quite a few pieces where every one of them is covering *all* the others.
In a []{#tangled_gambit .anchor}*tangled gambit*[]{.indexref
entry="tangled gambit:A gambit where a set of pieces are each covering all the others."},
the permutations of exchanges scale exponentially.

#### Peeking Gambits

Peeking provides a wealth of potential gambits and are often associated
with trapdoor moves but can stand on their own. A []{#peeking_gambit
.anchor}*peeking gambit*[]{.indexref
entry="peeking gambit:A gambit where peeking is the fundamental element."}
can occur because of a piece which moves so as to attack a like piece
taking advantage of an existing third piece, or it can arise when a
third piece is moved so as to convert a bidirectional attack into a
one-way attack.

Peeking is only possible for non-apex moves and bishop linear moves.
Like other attacks, peeking can be discovered, and it is possible to set
up multiple peeking attacks with one move; a kind of peeking fork.

#### Post Trapdoor Gambits

In 2D chess, after a piece has moved, its retreat may be cutoff with a
direct block. However, there is no way in 2D chess to set this up with a
move *before* the forward advance because the blocking piece would block
the forward advance as well as the retreat. A trapdoor can only be set
up in 3D.[^57]

When retreat is blocked post move in 2D, the retreating piece is forced
to use different advancement manifolds than it advanced in. In 3D, if
the blocking piece advances within the RAM region between the source and
destination tiles, this also forces a retreat in different advancement
manifolds. However, if it plays outside of the RAM region, then it is
possible for retreat to occur using the same advancement manifold.

There are therefore two types of []{#trapdoor_gambits .anchor}*trapdoor
gambits*; pre move and post move, but not all post move blocks of a
retreat are a post trapdoor gambit[]{.indexref
entry="trapdoor gambit:A gambit where a pre or post trapdoor is the fundamental element."}.

#### Snapdragon Gambits

A []{#snapdragon_gambit .anchor}*snapdragon gambit*[]{.indexref
entry="snapdragon gambit:A gambit where capture of blocking piece fails to restore the attack."}
takes advantage of the fact that not all blocks when captured restore
the attack. It is a clever way, with a small sacrifice, to re-sequence a
tangled mess of attack and cover.

Peeking gambits, pre and post trapdoor gambits, and snapdragon gambits
all depend on the fact that in 3D the forward and retreat advancement
manifolds may not fully overlay each other.

#### Blocking Gambits

In 2D, both attacks of a fork cannot be blocked with one piece or in one
move, but in 3D this is occasionally possible. In a
[]{#fork_block_gambit .anchor}*fork block gambit*[]{.indexref
entry="fork block gambit:A gambit which blocks two or more attacks from a fork."},
two or more of forks are blocked with single move. They are possible
because advancement manifolds can overlap in 3D chess.

#### Fickle Pin Gambits

A fickle block pins the originally attacked piece to the blocking piece.
While neither piece can be captured, neither can either piece move. This
isn't necessarily helpful, but a well-constructed []{#fickle_pin_gambit
.anchor}*fickle pin gambit*[]{.indexref
entry="fickle pin gambit:A gambit where a block pins the new protected piece."}
buys time forcing or inviting the attacking piece to strike elsewhere.
These all derive from []{#blocking_gambits .anchor}*blocking
gambits*[]{.indexref
entry="blocking gambits:Any gambit which inherits from blocking."}.

#### Stonewall Gambits

A stonewall block frees the originally attacked piece to move because it
is in a mutual block with other pieces in all the planes in which the
attacking piece can threaten it. A []{#stonewall_gambit
.anchor}*stonewall gambit*[]{.indexref
entry="stonewall gambit:A gambit where the block doesnât pin but is also not under attack."}
takes advantage of the fact that linear moves require both quadrants to
be empty and thus require two additional and fortuitously placed pieces.
These all derive from *blocking gambits*[]{.indexref
entry="blocking gambits:Any gambit which inherits from blocking."}.

#### Saturation Gambits

In 2D the number of directions a piece can move in determined its
degrees of freedom, and the number of pieces it can simultaneously
cover, and these were static numbers. In 3D, the values of these
parameters are dynamic; they depend on the details of what pieces are
covered. The rook can attack 12 pieces in quadrants, but only 4 if all
are linear moves. In a []{#saturation_gambit .anchor}*saturation
gambit*[]{.indexref
entry="saturation gambit:A gambit where a piece no longer attacks a tile typically within reach."}*,*
a piece fails to cover a tile it could normally attack because there are
so many other pieces taxing its threats. The saturation
gambit[]{.indexref
entry="saturation gambit:A gambit where a piece no longer attacks a tile typically within reach."}
played a critical role in the king checkmate example.

#### Pawn Gambits

Where to begin. This is likely to be an important and large class of
gambits. As has already been noticed, even two pawns on the same level
offer multiple possible gambits. In 3D, pawns can capture *two* levels
away and on the *same* level. En passants are much richer and pawn walls
can be more tightly interconnected. Opposing pawns on the same level do
not necessarily block each other, and pawns are harder to fence in 3D.
In addition, there will be pawn gambits associated with unshackled
pawns, as well as those which merely threaten unshackling. A
[]{#pawn_gambit .anchor}*pawn gambit*[]{.indexref
entry="pawn gambit:Any gambit unique to one or more pawns."} is one
where one pawn is central or where two or more pawns work together
toward a common objective.

#### Stack Gambits

Ok, deep breath. A []{#stack_gambit .anchor}*stack gambit*[]{.indexref
entry="stack gambit:Any gambit unique to the stack."} is one where the
concept of a stack is central. It might be anchored by a stack that
moves, or decays, or fissions. It might be anchored by a bishop and a
duke that recombine or cross combine. It might involve two like
sub-pieces and one unlike sub-piece as in teleportation, or even just
one sub-piece and a pawn which needs to promote by uplift upon an
occupied tile. In principle, fissions can capture two pieces at once,
which means that a stack fission can be a defense against some kinds of
forks. Then, as we saw earlier, there are even gambits that force a way
to capture half a stack.

#### The Bridge Gambit

In the dual bishop endgame, a pair of bishops can cleave the board into
14 almost disjoint regions called islands which are connected solely by
the king's ability to make a duke linear move. These connections are
called bridges. In the []{#bridge_gambit .anchor}*bridge
gambit*[]{.indexref
entry="bridge gambit:A king chases another down duke bridges in the dual bishop endgame."},
the protagonist king chases the lone king down a chain of bridges. If
the bridges form a network or a cycle, this chase is fruitless, but when
the chain is simply linear, the chase ends with the lone king trapped.

There are lots of variations here as bridge networks come in four colors
and can be interconnected thus changing their net architecture. In
addition, changing the position of the bishops reshuffles the bridge
network.

### Devious Gambits

To find rules for 3D play that felt like chess required a careful
selection of which 2D invariants to honor and which to shun. In addition
to the shunned invariants, the discovered rules also had implications
that occasionally violated other less fundamental invariants. Those with
deep expertise with 2D chess can find these violations jarring; they
partially invalidate the hard-won lessons of what works in chess, of
what is possible, what is not, and what the winning strategies and
tactics are. Such expertise is a kind of sunk cost; and such players
justifiably resist walking away from such an investment. Some of their
instincts will not hold up in the new venue.

Gambits which are anchored by one of these violated invariants shall be
called []{#devious .anchor}*devious*[]{.indexref
entry="devious:Gambits which leverage broken 2D invariants."}; and all
the gambits considered in this chapter meet that criteria. They are
however, where the fun is, where the newness is large enough to reach
the category of adventure. Should you find yourself playing 3D chess
against an opponent with a long and successful history of 'flat' chess,
the devious[]{.indexref
entry="devious:Gambits which leverage broken 2D invariants."} gambits
are your new best friend.

### The Art of Chess Gambits

There are potentially hundreds of 3D gambits worthy of discovery, study,
and application. Here are some suggested guidelines for identifying,
naming, and characterizing a new gambit.

A gambit should have a clever, descriptive name. It likely has a
heritage or is an instance of a class of gambits and that
relationship[]{.indexref
entry="relationship:Fixed piece is either beyond the active perimeter, on it, or short of it."}
should be explicitly identified. An example or two of the gambit is of
course de rigor. The description should wrap up with a concise statement
of strengths, weaknesses, and the contexts in which it applies or
arises.

### Review

Most of the gambits of 2D translate over to 3D with little to no
divergence, but the vast majority of 3D gambits have no analog in 2D.
Nearly a dozen examples of gambits unique to 3D were covered in some
detail and with accompanying figures, and many more hinted at via brief
descriptions.

This only scratches the surface.

Descriptive names were given to specific gambits and to some classes of
gambits and a few tips offered for how to find, name, and characterize
gambits. It was suggested that any 3D gambit which relied on a broken 2D
invariant be typed as *devious*[]{.indexref
entry="devious:Gambits which leverage broken 2D invariants."}.

The study of gambits can get tedious, especially if there are a great
many of them, but the devious[]{.indexref
entry="devious:Gambits which leverage broken 2D invariants."} gambits
pretty much come down to the consequences of two deep truths about
advancement manifolds; they can overlap in unexpected ways when they
didn't in 2D, and can fail to fully overlap when they did in 2D.

Pay attention to the advancement squares; from the same piece, from
multiple pieces, from forward and retreat moves; they are a reliable
guide to new gambits.

All the conceptual categories of tactics and strategies of 2D gambits
are alive and well in the 3D midgame, plus a host of new ones. It
doesn't just *feel like chess*, it feels like super chess.

## Openings

Regardless of the dimension in which chess is played,[^58] the
fundamentals remain the same; control the center, keep the initiative,
maximize your flexibility while minimizing your opponent's, protect your
king, develop your pieces but avoid the need to retreat, and position
them to take advantage of gambits you understand well. In addition, in
both games, the early moves of an opening depend heavily on pawns,
knights, and bishops (and dukes in 3D) typically in that order. In 2D,
it is generally regarded that castling marks the transition from opening
to midgame, and that same demarcation works in 3D as well.

### Starting Lineup

In both venues, from the starting position, no piece other than a pawn
or a knight can make the first move. Every pawn is protected by one or
more major pieces, but no pawn protects another. In 2D, the initial row
of pawns is covered 14 ways, for an average pawn coverage of 14/8 =
175%. In 3D, the initial column of pawns in covered in 20 ways (not
counting quarks) for an average pawn coverage of 20/8 = 250%, a bit
larger, but comparable. The 2D knights cover only the two royal pawns,
2/8 = 25%. The biggest difference in 3D is that the knights no longer
cover the royal pawns at all, 0/8 = 0%. Even so, the other pieces more
than make up for that decrease.

### Torque[]{.indexref entry="torque:Number of tiles covered by a cooperating group of pieces."}

*Torque*[]{.indexref
entry="torque:Number of tiles covered by a cooperating group of pieces."}
is the power projection for a group of cooperating pieces. Comparing the
starting lineup torque between 2D and 3D is revealing. The starting
lineup torque is the sum total of all the tiles that are covered by the
pawns and knights when the game starts. In both games, every advance
tile covered by a knight is also covered by a pawn.

In 2D, the knights have half the torque of the pawns, but in 3D the
knights have Â¼ the torque they had in 2D. For the pawns the situation is
much better. The torque of the pawns also decreases but not by very
much. Pawn torque is 75% of what it is in 2D.

: []{#_Toc210218563 .anchor}Table 15: **Initial Torque**[]{.indexref
entry="torque:Number of tiles covered by a cooperating group of pieces."}

Figure 214 shows the opening knight (Black) and pawn (White) torque for
both 2D & 3D; with yellow decorators for the knights' cover[]{.indexref
entry="cover:Can move to a tile, generic term for attack foe or defend friend."}
tiles for Black, and green/blue decorators for the pawns'
cover[]{.indexref
entry="cover:Can move to a tile, generic term for attack foe or defend friend."}
tiles for White. They are separated merely for clarity, as every advance
tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
a knight covers is also covered by a pawn, an invariant[]{.indexref
entry="invariant:A pattern which remains constant while other things change."}
between 2D & 3D chess. Obviously, both players have both torques. Where
a pawn can advance to is not counted in the torque computation; only
where it can capture. This figure will be used to compare 2D & 3D to
each other, but also to generate some stats that shed insight into the
openings about to be considered.

The region between the two players in 2D is a uniform two tiles wide
across the entire board; call it []{#no_mans_land .anchor}*no man's
land*[]{.indexref
entry="no manâs land:Region between the pawns in the starting lineup."}*.*
It looks completely different in 3D. It is no longer uniformly wide, and
it no longer cleaves the board. Knight power projection toward the
center is diminished, but pawn power projection is enhanced, for a net
gain in starting torque. As in 2D, pawns can engage with but a single
move on each side. White is going to find it more challenging to confine
Black, and Black is going to have an easier time of it; the balance of
power between White and Black in 3D is even more finely tuned than in 2D
chess.

![[]{#_Ref77434360 .anchor}Figure 214: Opening Torque[]{.indexref
entry="torque:Number of tiles covered by a cooperating group of pieces."}](media/image215.png){alt="A picture containing diagram Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="7.719444444444444in"}

Knight and pawn torque in 2D (a) and 3D (b). For clarity, knight torque
is shown for Black, pawn torque for White. In both games, tiles covered
by knights are already covered by pawns. No man's land in 2D is two
tiles wide, cleaved and uniform, in 3D its width is variable and jagged.

### Single Advance Tiles

In 3D, the single advance tiles divide themselves into two groups; 8
apex tiles and 16 end tiles, so it is fitting to compare the 2D
situation with each group separately, as well as with the entire set of
24 tiles. In both venues every single-advance tile is protected by other
pawns, many are also protected by a knight.

In 2D, each single-advance tile is protected by two pawns except the
rook pawns which are only singly covered, for an average pawn coverage
of 14/8 = 175%, and half of them are protected by a knight, for an
average knight coverage of 4/8 = 50%.

In 3D, half of the 8 single-advance apex tiles are protected by a
knight, so the primary plane is exactly similar to the 2D case with a
coverage of 4/8 = 50% in both cases. However, only 4 of the end tiles
are covered by knights. These are those in front of the royal pawns (in
some sense, this is where the 2D coverage of the starting position of
the royal pawns, absent in 3D, came from). Knight coverage of the end
tiles is therefore only 4/16 = 25%. Combined, the knight coverage of
single-advance tiles is down from Â½ in 2D to 1/3^rd^ in 3D.

Pawn coverage of the single-advance tiles is even stronger than in 2D.
The duke direct attack is exactly similar to the 2D case, every
single-advance apex tile is on a direct attack tile from two pawns
except the rook pawns which are only singly covered. However, all of
them are also covered by pawn predator attacks; the royal and bishop
pawns are covered by two predator pawns, the rook and knight pawns by
only one. Therefore, the average apex tile coverage by other pawns is
(14 + 8 + 4)/8 = 26/8 = 325%, almost double what it is in 2D.

However, each pawn also covers the single-advance apex tile in front of
it by the bead attack, for another 8 tiles of coverage; thus, 34/8 =
425% compared to the 175% value in the 2D case; an increase by a factor
of 2.42. While a bead attack increases power projection, it is of no
help in creating a pawn wall[]{.indexref
entry="pawn wall:Cooperating interconnected set of pawns which hamper development."}
but does find use in doubled pawns. It will generally be ignored when
analyzing openings.

Every single-advance end tile is double covered by the pawn reduced
attack, except the rook pawns which are singly covered, for a pawn
coverage of (12\*2 + 4)/16 = 175%, same value as in 2D. Altogether, the
8 apex tiles and the 16 end tiles have an average pawn coverage of (34 +
28)/24 = 258%, also a little larger than in 2D. Well-constructed pawn
walls are going to be more densely connected in 3D and thus stronger
than in 2D.

### Double Advance Tiles

In 2D, the double-advance tiles have no pawn coverage whatsoever; 0/8 =
0%.

In 3D, there are three types of double-advance tiles; apex, between, and
end tiles. There is no coverage by other pawns of the apex and end
tiles, but the dart attack does allow for coverage of the apex tile in
doubled pawn situations (two pawns on the same level), and there is
coverage by other pawns for the between tiles, which all fall on sling
tiles. Therefore, all the between tiles are double covered except for
the rook levels which are only singly covered; (12\*2 + 4)/16 = 175%.
The average coverage for double-advance tiles by other pawns is thus
(12\*2 + 4)/(5\*8) = 28/40 = 70%. If the dart tiles are included, then
the average coverage expands to 90%.

The tables below summarize these results.

: []{#_Toc210218565 .anchor}Table 17: **Pawn Coverage by Knights**

As one can see from the tables, the knights defend the pawns less in 2D,
but the other pieces more than make up for this, and, more importantly,
the pawns defend themselves better. While the coverage values are
different, they are surprisingly close to their 2D values.

### The Pawn Wall

It has been noted that while pawns are individually weak, they can be
quite formidable as a co-operating group. This is generally referred to
as a []{#pawn_wall .anchor}*pawn wall*[]{.indexref
entry="pawn wall:Cooperating interconnected set of pawns which hamper development."}.
In 2D, the pawn wall[]{.indexref
entry="pawn wall:Cooperating interconnected set of pawns which hamper development."}
cleaves the board between the players and White can use it effectively
to hem in Black. However, while it blocks rooks and pawns, it only
blocks one of the two bishops, and does not block the knight at all.
Thus, it doesn't stop the king or queen, just slows them down, so it is
a very porous 'wall.'

Being essentially a one-dimensional structure, it will not cleave the
board in 3D as it does in 2D, so it is even more porous in 3D, but
absolutely halting Black's development is not the most crucial aim
anyway; reducing Black's options is the real strategic objective. If
White has 1000 options and Black has only 100, then White's best move is
more likely to be better than Black's best move; by about a factor of 3.
This is what truly allows White to keep and extend the initiative.

There are five ways in which the pawn wall[]{.indexref
entry="pawn wall:Cooperating interconnected set of pawns which hamper development."}
is more effective in 3D. First, it can penetrate more deeply into the
opponent's territory because each pawn has a deeper reach, but also
because each pawn can be defended from farther back. These are the
benefits of the dart and sling tiles. Second, the advancement squares
have a different scaling law for the odds of blocking a move; N^2^
rather than just N. The farther a piece has to move, the more likely it
is that it is blocked, so the apparent openness of the pawn
wall[]{.indexref
entry="pawn wall:Cooperating interconnected set of pawns which hamper development."}
is less dramatic than it at first appears. Third, as was shown above,
pawns cover each other in multiple ways making a pawn wall[]{.indexref
entry="pawn wall:Cooperating interconnected set of pawns which hamper development."}
stronger and more resistant to attack. These are the benefits of the
predator, direct, and reduced tiles. Fourth, the predator tiles make it
less likely to create an []{#island_pawn .anchor}*island
pawn*[]{.indexref
entry="island pawn:A pawn with no possibility of coverage by other pawns."},
and bead and dart, reduce the penalty of doubled pawns. Fifth, the pawn
wall[]{.indexref
entry="pawn wall:Cooperating interconnected set of pawns which hamper development."}
can extend not only vertically, which is its prime analog with 2D, it
can also spread out sideways placing its end members closer to the back
planes, thus threatening sudden rapid promotion by unshackled pawns and
complicating the opponent's defensive situation.

The pawn wall[]{.indexref
entry="pawn wall:Cooperating interconnected set of pawns which hamper development."}
in 3D is not only stronger defensively, but also projects power better.
Compared with 2D, the 3D pawn wall[]{.indexref
entry="pawn wall:Cooperating interconnected set of pawns which hamper development."}
is more of an offensive weapon. In 2D, a pawn may defend one pawn and
attack one foe. At least one tile a pawn can cover must be used to
defend another pawn for there to be a pawn wall, and if it defends only
a single other pawn, the pawn wall is weak and easy to break. In
contrast, a pawn in 3D, may defend two or three other pawns and still
attack multiple foes. A heavily interconnected pawn wall will have less
torque, a lightly interconnected pawn wall will have more torque.

### Tooth-to-Tail Ratio

An important measure of the power of a group of pieces is the
[]{#tooth_to_tail_ratio .anchor}*tooth-to-tail ratio*[]{.indexref
entry="tooth-to-tail ratio:Ratio of deliverable force to the logistics of generating that force."},
a military term that measures the ratio of deliverable force to the
logistics of generating that force.

In the context of a pawn wall, the tooth-to-tail ratio[]{.indexref
entry="tooth-to-tail ratio:Ratio of deliverable force to the logistics of generating that force."}
is the number of cover[]{.indexref
entry="cover:Can move to a tile, generic term for attack foe or defend friend."}
tiles that have to be devoted to protecting other pawns, rather than
threatening the opponent. In 2D, the number is dismal, less than 1 to 1;
each pawn can cover[]{.indexref
entry="cover:Can move to a tile, generic term for attack foe or defend friend."}
two pieces (except the rook pawns), if one of those is taken by another
pawn, required for a minimum strength pawn wall[]{.indexref
entry="pawn wall:Cooperating interconnected set of pawns which hamper development."},
that leaves only one left to harass the opposition. Further, there is no
redundancy in a 2D pawn wall[]{.indexref
entry="pawn wall:Cooperating interconnected set of pawns which hamper development."}.

In 3D, the pawn tooth-to-tail ratio[]{.indexref
entry="tooth-to-tail ratio:Ratio of deliverable force to the logistics of generating that force."}
skyrockets. It is 13 to 1 on a tile basis, and from a low of 4 to 1, to
a high of 8 to 1 on a piece basis. With such a high tooth-to-tail
ratio[]{.indexref
entry="tooth-to-tail ratio:Ratio of deliverable force to the logistics of generating that force."}
a very strong pawn wall[]{.indexref
entry="pawn wall:Cooperating interconnected set of pawns which hamper development."}
can be constructed because cover[]{.indexref
entry="cover:Can move to a tile, generic term for attack foe or defend friend."}
can be redundant. If every pawn covers 2 others, it still has an average
tooth-to-tail ratio[]{.indexref
entry="tooth-to-tail ratio:Ratio of deliverable force to the logistics of generating that force."}
of 6/2 = 3; yielding a wall twice as strong and thrice as threatening.

Pawn walls are going to be much richer in 3D.

### The Center Tiles

In 2D, there are 4 center tiles (2^2^), in 3D, there are 8 center tiles
(2^3^). Before trying to analyze specific openings, let's get a feel for
the territory. In the next few figures we'll be considering the torque
that White can develop by double advancing her royal pawns to the 4,4
tiles and advancing her knights to the bishop 3,3 tiles.

Figure 215 shows the situation with the four pieces moved (Black's
responses have been suppressed). Only the pawn decorators are shown in
this figure. In both 2D and 3D, the royal pawns threaten every center
tile they do not occupy. Figure 216 adds the decorators for the knights,
and Figure 217 adds the decorators for the duke part of the stacks.

![[]{#_Ref77606209 .anchor}Figure 215: Openings -- Royal Pawns Double
Advance
Torque](media/image216.png){alt="Shape Description automatically generated with medium confidence"
width="6.5in" height="7.719444444444444in"}

Double advanced royal pawns penetrate into Black's territory, just
barely in 2D (a), more deeply in 3D (b). In both 2D & 3D, they attack
all the center tiles they don't occupy, but fail to protect each other
and are not themselves protected by any of the other pawns.

![[]{#_Ref77606191 .anchor}Figure 216: Openings -- Royal Pawns & Knight
Torque](media/image217.png){width="6.5in" height="7.719444444444444in"}

The decorators for the knights are added to the previous figure. As in
2D, the 3D knights cover all the center tiles not occupied by the royal
pawns, but unlike the case in 2D (a), they no longer cover the pawns
themselves (b).

![[]{#_Ref77607120 .anchor}Figure 217: Openings -- Royal Pawns, Knight &
Stack-Duke
Torque](media/image218.png){alt="A picture containing shape Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="7.719444444444444in"}

At this stage, the duke plays a role in 3D more in line with the bishops
in 2D; therefore, blue decorators have been used for the 2D bishops for
consistency. After just four moves, this is the threat environment Black
must play into. Bishop decorators not shown, but q-tiles hint at them.

With one exception, the similarities between 2D & 3D are remarkably
strong. That difference is that the 3D knights do not protect their own
royal pawns even though they would threaten the opponent's royal pawns
should they mirror the pawn moves.

On first blush, we were concerned that with the number of empty tiles
growing from just 32 in 2D to a whopping 480 in 3D, that White would
have a more difficult time confining Black but look at the threat
environment Black has to step into. Both his single and double advances,
on either the same level or the opposite level, leave him worse off than
in 2D.

If he double advances on the same level to the apex tile, he is under
attack by bead, whereas in 2D he would be safe. If he does so advance,
then PxP and White has deeply penetrated into Black territory. Every
attack on the forward pawn can be matched by White; she can defend with
either pawn or knight.

If he double advances to the apex tile on the opposite level, he is
under attack by direct duke attack, which is the analog of the 2D case.
Again, if PxP, White has deeply penetrated into Black territory and it
is easy for her to defend it.

A double advance to a between tile is a protected move, but White can
now advance her pawn. Double advances to end tiles are not protected and
remain remote from promotion. Single advances are even worse.

Note that the second q-tile for the white-gold stack will check the king
by duke move if the queen pawn has been advanced and if Black has not
advanced bishop pawn or knight to B3,3. While easy to block, this has
simultaneously developed both duke and bishop, and the bishop is free to
leave the stack by decay and further develop while keeping the pressure
on the king.

### Survey of 2D Openings

With this first glance at the landscape, let's do a quick survey of some

  : []{#_Ref80111528 .anchor}Table 18: **A Map of Ten 2D Chess King Pawn
  Openings**

This may not be the conventional way of looking at openings, but it has
the advantage of highlighting some common themes in chess openings.
First, it's all about pawns, knights, and bishops; queen development is
typically later. Second, pawns are exchanged or sacrificed early in the
game, the later generally being indicated when the word 'gambit' is in
the name of the opening. Third, the center and bishop files figure
prominently, as do the 3^rd^ and 4^th^ ranks. Fourth, pawns are used to
block the advance of opposing pawns.

### The Greedy Opening

Because of the bead attack in 3D, Black cannot mirror a 4,4 advance, he
cannot advance his corresponding pawn to the apex tile of the double
advance for he will be under attack and defenseless; at best it is a
counter gambit. White simply captures the pawn, gaining material while
deepening her development into Black territory, and she can defend this
pawn with one move by either knight, or bishop pawn, or royal pawn, and
Black cannot even attack this tile with his knight.

Instead, Black must make a double advance to a between tile, which is
protected by both royal and bishop pawns.

Now White faces her first big decision about what kind of opening she
wants to play. If she advances the pawn, she has projected power deep
into Black's territory, but has moved the pawn *twice*. Alternatively,
she can advance another pawn or *develop* a minor piece. Both options
have pros and cons. Project or develop?

White can advance this pawn to 5,5 secure that it can be protected by
the knight, or by either royal or bishop pawn. From that position it
prevents Black from developing one knight to its B3,3 tile by duke
direct attack, and prevents the other knight from moving to *three* of
its four possible moves; its move to B3,3 is blocked by predator attack
and it's pair of moves to the royal level is blocked by sling attacks.
Its only remaining move is to the rook plane. Of the 8 possible knight
moves, this one forward pawn has denied Black *half* of them.

Black must address this thorn in his side; threatening it with either a
pawn or a bishop, but unlike the case in 2D, no knight can immediately
touch it. If he chooses to attack with a pawn, he has four choices, but
advancing the other royal pawn is probably the strongest.

This is also a trap for White, for if 3. PxP then PxP, leaving White
without a presence in the center, and Black with two royal pawns
advanced 1Â½ moves, but also capable of advancing either one even further
such that the forward pawn is protected. Even though it is now White's
turn, she has squandered her initiative and separated her pawns into two
groups which can only be reconnected by predator tiles. While the deeply
penetrating pawn hampers Black's development, it has cost White one
move, and thus Black can develop his minor pieces one step ahead of
White seizing the initiative and forcing White into a reactive game.

Figure 218 shows the state of the board after move 2, along with
decorators for the forward White pawn's capture tiles and Black's knight
options. White's forward []{#scout_pawn .anchor}*scout pawn*[]{.indexref
entry="scout pawn:A relatively isolated pawn deep in enemy territory."}
is all alone and under attack.

![[]{#_Ref77945587 .anchor}Figure 218: Opening Greedy Move

width="6.5in" height="7.276388888888889in"}

1\. P-K4,4 P-K4,3 2. P-K5,5 P-Q4,3

White has taken advantage of Black's inability to block a pawn in one
move. While this allows her to project power deeply into Black's
territory (*half* his knight moves are covered) this *scout*
pawn[]{.indexref
entry="scout pawn:A relatively isolated pawn deep in enemy territory."}
has been moved *twice*. It is all alone and under attack. If she trades
pawns, she leaves Black in control of the center and can no longer
safely advance her queen pawn to the 2^nd^ apex tile.

Instead, she should defend this pawn. She has multiple options.
Generally, developing a knight to the bishop level leaves it vulnerable
to a dart attack by the opposing bishop pawn. However, in this case,
such an attack by Black would allow White to capture the bishop pawn by
en passant. White saves this option for later.

She also has the option to develop the other royal pawn, but because of
Black's advance to a between tile, this pawn can no longer safely move
to the double advance apex tile. Instead, White makes an aggressive move
and double advances it to a between tile, 3. P-Q3,4; the one that has a
mutual dart attack with the queen pawn. This move protects the scout
pawn[]{.indexref
entry="scout pawn:A relatively isolated pawn deep in enemy territory."},
is itself protected by the bishop pawn and queen, and should it be
captured in a pawn exchange, the current tile will then be covered by
the queen bishop. Defenses in depth.

However, advance to either of the between tiles opens the queens to
mutual attacks. This is unique to 3D chess. Even though neither queen
pawn has left the queen level, because neither has remained in the
primary major plane, the two queens are attacking each other by a bishop
linear move. One of these two planes are blocked by Black's king pawn,
but the other is open: perimeter 7 in both directions.

This leaves Black with a conundrum. If he captures the king pawn and the
bishop pawn in turn captures, then White has two pawns in the center to
Black's one, the rearward protects the forward, and his knight
development is still hampered. An end tile advance by the White QN pawn
would complete a pawn wall. If he doesn't, White can capture with either
pawn. While Black's queen pawn is multiply covered, keeping that cover
limits development of his QB pawn.

If he nonetheless develops this pawn, then White can capture by the king
pawn leading to a Texas two-step gambit or capture by the queen pawn
which puts the queen pawn one move away from checking the king and
disrupting Black's ability to castle or forcing Black to prematurely
dissolve his stack.

Black could develop either stack to a knight level (2^nd^ shell q-tile).
Instead, he decides to simplify, expecting to disrupt White's ability to
castle...

3...QxQ(lb) 4. DxQ(minor)

but only succeeds in dissolving White's king-side stack. Black chooses
to develop his queen-side stack threatening White's scout
pawn[]{.indexref
entry="scout pawn:A relatively isolated pawn deep in enemy territory."}
(downward plane) while simultaneously defending his queen pawn (leftward
plane); a multi-function move. This puts Black one move away from being
able to castle queen side and two moves away from being able to castle
king side; whereas White is still 3 and 2 moves away respectively,
exactly as far as when the game started. Because of the extra move of
the scout pawn[]{.indexref
entry="scout pawn:A relatively isolated pawn deep in enemy territory."},
Black has been able to wrestle the initiative away from White.

Figure 219 shows the situation at the end of move 4.

![[]{#_Ref77945609 .anchor}Figure 219: Opening Greedy Move

width="6.5in" height="7.276388888888889in"}

3\. P-Q3,4 QxQ(lb) 4. DxQ(minor) S-KN5,1

White defends his scout pawn[]{.indexref
entry="scout pawn:A relatively isolated pawn deep in enemy territory."}
on K5,5 by advancing his Q pawn off diagonal exposing the queens to
mutual bishop linear attacks. Black captures her queen; White captures
his queen by stack decay of white-gold duke in the minor plane. Black
develops his queen-side stack to the q-tile on the KN level covering
both the scout pawn[]{.indexref
entry="scout pawn:A relatively isolated pawn deep in enemy territory."}
and his queen pawn. Black is more developed than White.

Now White advances her king-side knight to the bishop level, defending
the scout pawn[]{.indexref
entry="scout pawn:A relatively isolated pawn deep in enemy territory."}.
Black makes his first mistake of the opening, double advancing his KN
pawn to the apex tile in an attempt to threaten White's king-side knight
with a dart attack, but he has missed the en passant. White captures en
passant which Black wisely recaptures via predator attack from the
king-side rook pawn opening his king rook while keeping a good pawn
wall.

Figure 220 shows the greedy opening after move 6.

5\. N-KB3,3 P-KB4,4 6. PxP ep KRPxP

White defends his scout pawn[]{.indexref
entry="scout pawn:A relatively isolated pawn deep in enemy territory."}
with his king-side knight, Black threatens with a dart attack by double
apex advance of his KB pawn, but White captures it en passant via his
king pawn to KB 6,6. Black captures by rook pawn opening the top level
to his rook Ghost pieces indicate previous positions.

White is desperate to catch up. She develops her bishop threatening to
block Black's ability to castle queen side by threatening Q8,8 which
Black's king would have to move through for a vertical queen-side
castle, but also threatening K8,7 which Black's king would have to move
through for a royal castle in his right back plane. However, the bishop
does not threaten a royal castle in his left back plane. Until Black
develops his king-side stack, neither royal castle is possible because
the stack would block the advancement square of the queen rook.

Black blocks this by advancing his queen pawn. White is then able to
castle king side but only vertically, the duke on the queen level
prevents a royal castle. Black develops his queen-side knight opening
him for a vertical queen-side castle.

White has been able to castle before Black but is nonetheless behind in
development. Both of her dukes are still blocked by pawns in the major
plane, and none of the queen side pieces have been developed. Black has
better control of the center and his king rook can enter the fray at any
time.

Figure 221 shows the greedy opening after move 8.

![[]{#_Ref77946362 .anchor}Figure 221: Opening Greedy Move
8](media/image222.png){alt="Shape, arrow Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="7.276388888888889in"}

7\. B-QB2,3 K-QB3,3 8. C-KN1,1,KB1,1 P-Q4,4

White develops her king-side bishop hoping to prevent Black from
castling. Black develops his queen-side knight hoping to castle. White
makes a 2D like castle, his horizontal castle is blocked by his gold
duke. Black advances his pawn to block the castle threat of White's
bishop.

The source of White's difficulties in this opening was the scout
pawn[]{.indexref
entry="scout pawn:A relatively isolated pawn deep in enemy territory."}
as it required two moves. Moving any piece more than once during the
opening almost guarantees loss of the initiative; this is as true in 3D
as it is in 2D. The considerations in both venues are the same; the
strategies are the same, but the tactics are different -- the piece to
piece interactions in 3D opening are different.

Let's go over some of those differences.

### Contrast with 2D Openings

The first obvious difference is the reach of the 3D pawns; in
particular, that they can capture on their own level, not just one
diagonal tile ahead (bead) but even *two* (dart). This means that Black
cannot mirror a double advance and *physically* block White's pawn.
However, a 1-1/2 advance to a between tile had the same effect and can
therefore count as a *tactical* block. White was foolish to push the
scout pawn[]{.indexref
entry="scout pawn:A relatively isolated pawn deep in enemy territory."}
farther before a more complete development of her other pieces.

While the standard advance of the knights to the bishop level attacks
the most important double advance tiles of the opponent (apex &
between), that move no longer protects the friendly pawns similarly
advanced. In addition, the long reach of the dart attack means that
opposing pawns can threaten such knights on their very first move,
forcing the knights to move a second time.

Another big contrast was the vulnerability of the queens. The fact that
the queens can find themselves in a mutual attack situation before
either queen pawn has left the queen level comes as a big surprise.

This same surprise exists for the stacks. If both pawns on a bishop
level go off the primary major plane, the two bishops are each attacking
the other stack, unless two other pieces, one in each outward plane,
coincidently block the attack. At least such a pair would block both
attacks, since the inside perimeters of the advancement rectangles
follow the contours of the board; no possibility for a peeking
situation.

Whoever blinks first loses; exchanging a stack for a mere bishop.

The effect of this symmetric attack between queens and between stacks is
that their associated pawns get pinned very early in the game; what
happens in the center of the board doesn't stay in the center.

There isn't much that can be done about the knight move, but one could
consider restrictions on pawn and queen, and frankly, the strongest
arguments for handicapping these pieces to something less than their
full 3D nature comes from the openings.

One could by fiat deny pawns the right to capture to any tile they can
advance to. One could also deny the queen the right to advance to any
tile as a higher base piece if it could also reach it as a lower base
piece (on an empty board). This effectively eliminates overlap tiles for
the queen, and for consistency sake probably the stack as well. It would
mean that the queen could not make a linear bishop move (covered by rook
apex), nor a duke duplex move (covered by rook linear) or even a duke
apex move (covered by both rook apex and bishop linear), and no move to
a Feynman tile as a duke either (covered by bishop apex).

Both of these handicaps could be considered balance rules. However, they
violate a deep chess invariant; that base pieces should be *independent*
of one another. What one base piece can do should not degrade (or be
enhanced for that matter) by what another base piece could do.

Even if all of the above could be fixed, we would still be left with the
mutual bishop/stack attacks.

This is no small matter; it bears directly on the claim of what we mean
by *feels like chess*. Before second guessing ourselves on what
discovery has taught us about how pieces should move in three
dimensions, it might be wise to recall that we've only looked at one
opening. It should also be noted, that 3D chess branches much faster
than 2D chess. This makes the openings much more complicated and
difficult to analyze. There is a silver lining to a large number of
obvious bad moves; it prunes the game tree and makes openings a little
easier.

We should actually be beginning, not with strong openings, but with weak
ones; here are all the things *not* to do. The moves that are left then
become the core components of 3D openings.

### Fool's Mate

In 2D chess, a fool's mate is a game where one player makes a series of
extraordinarily bad moves which his opponent can take advantage of for a
rapid checkmate. They exist in 3D as well.

Figure 222 shows an example in both 2D and 3D of example fool's mates.
In both cases, Black blunders his opening leaving his king hemmed in and
exposed in such a way that blocking the coming check is not possible. In
2D, the queen advances like a bishop and mates as one as well. In 3D,
the queen advances like a duke and mates as one as well. The
similarities and differences are suggestive in both directions.

Note the assist from the king-side stack via bishop decay. Only the
straight-line tiles of the linear move have been shown, but the linear
move is unblocked in both outward planes. The stack attacks by bishop
decay threaten the only tile the Black king has access to.

Sometimes, when you can't figure out the best thing to do, the correct
strategy is to at least identify what you shouldn't do. This one
certainly qualifies.

Move listing below.

[WHITE]{.underline} [BLACK]{.underline}

1 P -- K4,4 P -- KB3,2?

2 P -- KB4,3 B -- K2,1? (B-decay)

3 Q -- K8,2 ch mate

![[]{#_Ref78839771 .anchor}Figure 222: Openings -- Example Fool's
Mates](media/image223.png){alt="A picture containing shape Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="7.719444444444444in"}

Black blunders his opening and White takes advantage of it. In 2D, Black
opens 2 king-side pawns; White mates with her queen via bishop advance &
check (a). In 3D, Black opens 1 king-side pawn and splits his king-side
stack; White mates with her queen via duke advance and check (b).

### Stack Exposure

As noted above, the queens and both pairs of stacks have mutual attacks
via their bishop-like sub-moves when both pawns stray off the primary
major plane. In 2D, only the queen had this problem, and then only after
both pawns had left the file altogether. In 3D, the stacks join the
party, and the finer resolution doesn't require the pawns to leave the
level, just the primary major plane.

Figure 223 shows the situation for the queen-side stacks at the end of
move 1, with the decorators shown for White (it is her turn). The Astute
Reader may notice a change in the style of the figure. While this book
was being written, software to implement the game was simultaneously
under development. This is a snapshot from one of the early exploratory
versions of that software.[^59]

While the color coding is different, it should be apparent which tiles
are end tiles, which are apex and which are body, and of course, which
tiles are linear. Clearly, creating a software interface that is
effective at communicating a 3D situation is going to require some
craft.

Figure 224 shows the situation at the end of move 2, when White has
captured the stack by bishop decay and Black has captured the bishop by
the queen's rook attack. White is up in material; she has exchanged a
bishop (4 points) for a stack (6 points).

The game got a lot easier to explore (discover) once software could
augment our ability to perceive piece-to-piece interactions.

![[]{#_Ref78901282 .anchor}Figure 223: Openings -- Mutual Stack Attacks;
After the Pawns Leave the Primary Major
Plane](media/image224.png){alt="A picture containing colorful, line, colors, several Description automatically generated"
width="4.51in" height="7.2in"}

The queen side bishop pawns have both left the primary major plane
exposing each to attack from the other. The decorators are shown for
White's bishop decay attack (a linear move in both outward planes) on
Black as it is her turn. This snapshot was taken from an early version
of the Unity 3D Chess software.

![[]{#_Ref78901290 .anchor}Figure 224: Openings -- Mutual Stack Attacks;
After BxS & Before QxB](media/image225.png){width="4.51in"
height="7.2in"}

White has just captured Black's queen-side stack by bishop decay of her
black-silver stack. The decorators show the queen's available duke
moves, and more critically, her one rook move; a linear one in both
vertical planes, one that can capture the bishop. Early software didn't
show complete perimeters when a piece was under attack, only the tile
holding the target piece was highlighted.

### Four Pawns

In 2D, there are 4 center tiles (2^2^), in 3D, there are 8 center tiles
(2^3^). In both games, the pawn double advance allows both royal pawns
of both players to directly move to a center tile. Consider the case
where both players double advance *both* royal pawns. In 2D, the 4 pawns
occupy *all* the center tiles, in 3D, if they all advance to the apex
tiles, they only occupy *half* the center tiles. In 2D, each pawn is
under attack by *one* foe piece and *none* are covered by a friend piece
(except for the queen). In 3D, each pawn is under attack by *two* foe
pieces yet *none* are covered by a friend piece, again except for the
queen, (not even via duke, until the knight pawn moves).

In 2D, all center tiles except those occupied by friend pieces are under
pawn attack (2 tiles out of 4). In 3D, all center tiles except those
occupied by friend pieces are under pawn attack (6 tiles out of 8).
Makes an interesting invariant between 2D & 3D. In neither case do
either pair of friend center pawns protect each other.

Figure 225 shows this maximum face off situation. The overlapping bishop
and duke decorators are shown slightly offset for clarity.

In 2D, if PxP is followed by PxP, then White and Black pawns have
tunneled through each other and there is one of each, back to back, on
the *same* file; either the king file or the queen file, depending on
which capture happened first.

In 3D, if PxP (direct) then it can only be followed by PxP (direct), and
just like in 2D, the White and Black pawns have tunneled through each
other and there is one of each, back to back, on the *same* level;
either the king level or the queen level, depending on which capture
happened first.

However, if PxP(bead) then it can only be followed by PxP (bead), and
now while the pair of remaining pawns have passed each other, they are
on *different* levels; one on the king level and one on the queen level,
which one contains the White pawn depends on which capture happened
first.

![[]{#_Ref78919781 .anchor}Figure 225: Openings -- 4 Faceoff Pawns;

When both players double advance both royal pawns, they dominate the
board. In 2D (a), each pawn attacks the one diagonally opposed to it. In
3D (b), each pawn attacks one opposing pawn on the same level (bead
attack, green), *and* the other pawn one level away (direct attack,
blue).

Figure 226 shows the major possible results. In 2D, both surviving pawns
are on the same file, but in 2D, either both surviving pawns are on the
same level, or they are on different levels, depending upon whether the
captures were by duke moves (direct) or bishop moves (bead).

![[]{#_Ref78920186 .anchor}Figure 226: Openings -- 4 Faceoff Pawns; PxP,
PxP](media/image227.png){alt="A picture containing arrow Description automatically generated"
width="6.458333333333333in" height="5.277777777777778in"}

From the 4-pawn faceoff position, type and order of capture determine
the outcome. In 2D (a), there is only one type of capture (bishop) and
both pawns end up back-to-back on the same file; which file, king or
queen, depends on the order of the captures. In 3D, there are two types
of capture. If by direct (b), both pawns end up back-to-back on the same
level; which level, king or queen, depends on the order of the captures.
If by bead (c), the pawns end up on different levels, which level holds
which color pawn, depends on the order of the captures.

As we have seen so many times before, there are exact analogs in 3D
chess of 2D chess situations, but in between them fall new behaviors for
which there are no analogs.

### Castling Notation

Castling has more options in 3D than in 2D, so the old standard of
'king-side' or 'queen-side' doesn't have enough resolution to
disambiguate among the permutations. Castling moves the king either
*vertically* (analog with 2D) or horizontally (a *royal* castle). For
each there are *three* possible positions for the rook, but in the case
of double castling, there will be *two* rooks.

Let 'C' represent a castle. Vertical castles will then be 'CK' or 'CQ'
for king side and queen side respectively. Royal castles need to specify
the vertical plane; thus 'CL' or 'CR' for left or right plane castles.

After the double capital letters, there will be the rook's move, in
comma separated left right order. The three vertical castle[]{.indexref
entry="vertical castle:King castles up or down two levels, king side queen side respectively."}
options are 1,2; 1,1 & 2,1. The three royal castle options are 2,1 & 3,1
& 4,1 on the left, and 1,2 & 1,3 & 1,4 on the right. For double
castling, the king side rook is listed first, semi colon separated from
the queen rook.

As an example, a double castle in the left plane would look like
this...CL2,1;4,1.

### Knight's Gambit

We'll wrap up this chapter with a look at an opening where White
sacrifices a knight for rapid development.

Move listing below. We'll analyze it two moves at a time over the next
five figures.

[WHITE]{.underline} [BLACK]{.underline}

1\. P -- K4,4 P -- KB4,3

2\. N -- QB3,3 P -- QB4,4 -- threatens QN

3\. P -- Q3,4 PxN (dart)

4\. RPxP (predator) P -- Q4,4

5\. S -- QN5,1 ch-duke N -- QB3,3

6\. N -- KB3,3 PxP (direct)

7\. QxQ ch (l-bishop) DxQ (d-decay, minor)

8\. PxP (reduced) P -- QR4,2

9\. CK1,2 R -- QR2,4 peek

10\. B -- KR2,5 ch

This opening begins with advance of the king pawns; double apex advance
by White, 1. P-K4,4, followed by the maximum safe double advance by
Black to a between tile, 1... P-K4,3. White advances her king-side
knight, 2. N-KB3,3 and Black double apex advances his king bishop pawn,
2... P-KB4,4 threatening it via dart attack. The heart of this opening
is if White chooses not to move the threatened knight and Black captures
it with a pawn, which White can promptly capture in return. This would
put White down a knight for just a pawn, a slight material disadvantage,
and why this opening earns the term 'gambit.'

Figure 227 shows this opening at the end of move 2. The king pawns are
not fully blocked, but also do not attack each other. The White king
pawn and the Black queen bishop pawn, however, are mutually attacking
each other by predator attack. Black's queen bishop pawn is protected by
his bishop (not stack) while forking the pawn by predator and the knight
by dart. Further, it could apex advance while keeping pressure on the
knight with a bead attack. Note that the knight is protected by three
pawns, the predator coverage by the QR pawn is shown. To reduce clutter,
only the most relevant potential moves sport decorators.

White chooses to leave her knight in place and continues to develop the
center. If Black captures the knight, he can expect to lose the pawn,
but that puts him ahead in material. So, 3... PxN, but White had three
pawns defending the knight. In a move unique to 3D chess, she captures
with the queen rook pawn via the predator attack, 4. RPxP. Not only does
this bring a fringe pawn in range of the center tiles (it can now
project power to half of them, 4), it also develops the queen rook.
Black is overwhelmed in the center and so chooses to double apex advance
his queen pawn, 4... P-Q4,4. It was, and still is, pinned against its
queen by White's queen, but has engaged the White king pawn in a mutual
direct attack.

Figure 228 shows the knight's gambit at the end of move 4. White has a
densely interconnected pawn wall, and an easy to develop queen rook. She
also has pinned Black's queen and queen rook pawns. Both players are
poised to develop their stacks, but its White's turn. Decorators show
White's major options for her next move and the queen pawn pin; for
clarity, only the straight-line part of the linear move is shown.

Now the gambit begins in earnest. White advances her king side stack to
a q-tile on the queen night level, 5. S-QK5,1 which checks the Black
king by a duke move in the upleft plane. Black has several moves which
can block this check; he chooses to develop his queen-side knight which
is well protected in its new location, 5... N-QB3,3. White develops her
king-side knight, 6. N-KB3,3, which prevents Black from advancing his
queen pawn around White's, so he opts for 6.... PxP via direct capture,
forking White's queen pawn and knight, and discovering an attack on her
queen by his.

Figure 229 shows the knight's gambit at the end of move 6. White is down
a knight but has better development; Black's knight (his only developed
piece) is pinned against his king by White's stack (d-decay). White can
castle king side at any time and is also only one move away from full
development of her queen-side rook. The royal pawns are in a mutual
attack (reduced) as are the queens by linear bishop move. Dimmed
decorators show how the knight is pinned against the king. Note the
decorators for the two quadrants of the semi-linear pawn reduced
attacks.

![[]{#_Ref78979624 .anchor}Figure 227: Openings -- Knight's Gambit; Move
2](media/image228.png){alt="Shape Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="7.276388888888889in"}

White double apex advances her king pawn, with Black responding as far
as is safe. White brings out her queen knight which prevents Black from
advancing his king pawn to block White's pawn. Black double apex
advances his QB pawn threatening the knight (dart) and forking White's
king pawn (predator). This pawn is defended by the queen bishop but
under mutual attack by White's king pawn (predators) yet can maintain
pressure on the knight with an apex advance (bead).

![[]{#_Ref78991160 .anchor}Figure 228: Openings -- Knight's Gambit; Move
4](media/image229.png){alt="A picture containing shape Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="7.276388888888889in"}

Black accepts the gambit and is thus ahead in material (see the trays),
but behind in development. White has a semi-developed queen side rook
(the pawn is gone) and both stacks have open planes (decorators for the
king side stack are shown. White has the queen pawn pinned, so even
though the royal pawns are mutually attacking (direct), Black has fewer
options.

![[]{#_Ref79053824 .anchor}Figure 229: Openings -- Knight's Gambit; Move
6](media/image230.png){alt="A picture containing shape Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="7.276388888888889in"}

White has opened his king side for castling, by developing the stack,
simultaneously checking the king and forcing Black to block with his
knight which is therefore pinned. The queens are now mutually attacking
each other by linear bishop move, and Black is threatening White's sole
remaining knight with the forward pawn on the king level. Black could
advance this pawn and check White's king.

White now capitalizes on her superior development, 7. QxQ ch via linear
bishop move, which prevents Black from ever castling if he captures with
his king, and keeps him three moves away from castling on either side if
he captures with duke decay from his king-side stack, which is the
option he chooses, 7...DxQ via duke decay in the minor plane. Now White
captures the leading royal pawn, 8. PxP (reduced). Black hopes to stall
development of White's queen-side rook by advancing his rook pawn,
8...P-QR4,2, setting up the opportunity of creating a peeking situation
on the next move in a one-way attack on White's queen-side rook. This
pawn is defended by duke and rook.

Figure 230 shows the knight's gambit at the end of move 8. The
stack-duke decorators show that Black's knight is still pinned against
his king, and that White's forward queen bishop pawn is defending the
king pawn by predator attack. The two developed knights (White in
yellow, Black in slimy green), are largely ineffective at the moment.

White now castles king side, 9. CK1,2. This gives the rook access to
attack the center of the board in one move, which K1,1, would not.
However, it limits his development to one plane, the right vertical
plane. Had the queen-side stack not been there, K1,1, would have been
the stronger move. Black now makes good on his peeking threat between
the queen rooks, 9... R-QR2,3. White has a number of good responses, as
this rook is defended by the queen-side stack with its duke decay move
in the minor plane, and if White develops it, it is still defended by
the other rook in the right plane.

White could advance his forward queen bishop pawn to threaten the
knight, which is still pinned against his king, but better is to bishop
decay his queen stack to the king rook level simultaneously forking the
pinned knight and checking Black's king.

The mid game has begun. Black has only one well developed piece, against
White's four, has still not castled, and is still three moves away from
doing so. White can check Black in one move with his king-side rook, and
despite being down by a knight, has 7 pawns to Black's 6, which with the
queens gone, means White can win even if every exchange of material
going forward is even. Black is going to have a cramped, defensive game,
with bleak prospects.

Figure 231 shows the knight's gambit halfway through move 10. Black is
in check, his knight is still pinned and now under multiple attacks, and
White can threaten it with his queen bishop pawn in one move, although
it is currently the only protection for her king pawn.

![[]{#_Ref79060485 .anchor}Figure 230: Openings -- Knight's Gambit; Move
8](media/image231.png){alt="Diagram Description automatically generated with low confidence"
width="6.5in" height="7.276388888888889in"}

The knights have some utility to restrict various pawn advances, but
since the Black knight is still pinned against its king, not very much.
The queens are gone, leaving an empty level. White's queen bishop pawn
is still defending her king pawn by predator cover, but as this pawn is
not currently threatened that is sufficient. Note how Black as set
himself up for a peeking attack between his queen rook and White's on
the queen rook level.

![[]{#_Ref79060469 .anchor}Figure 231: Openings -- Knight's Gambit; Move
9.5](media/image232.png){alt="Shape Description automatically generated with low confidence"
width="6.5in" height="7.276388888888889in"}

White ignored the queen-side rook peeking attack as her rook is defended
in the minor plane by the queen duke, but bishop decayed her queen side
stack to fork the pinned knight and check the king. Given the absence of
the queens, and the knight-pawn swap, White can eventually win this game
with just an even exchange of material going forward for her extra pawn
can promote to a queen and Black's knight advantage is insufficient to
prevent checkmate.

In this opening, four of the six pawn attacks were demonstrated, and
pawn double advances used all three tile types; apex, between, & end.
Forking was seen, nothing new, but peeking also occurred, and that is
new. The stack both moved as a stack, when it could, but also
demonstrated decay moves, both bishop and duke decays. It was evident
that dukes via their minor plane can offer a lot of protection up and
down the home column. Castling, rather conventionally, occurred, as did
an early loss of both queens. Also, the first hints of how to build
effective pawn walls showed up;

### Review

What this brief investigation into openings reveals is several tactical
differences between 2D and 3D openings; knights fail to defend one's own
royal pawns while still attacking the opponent's, the pawn's threatening
reach confines Black from move one but Black can use it to harass the
knights, and of course the queen and stack/bishop mutual attacks and
pawn pins. However, the fundamentals strategies of openings are
unchanged; control of the center, development, initiative, sacrifices,
forks, pins, check, castling, all play the same role and remain crucial
to entering the mid game with any hope of victory. Despite a larger
board with so many empty tiles, despite the planar move with its
advancement squares, despite the larger power projection, and despite
the much larger branching ratio in the move tree, the game develops just
as fast.

Feels like chess? So, it would seem.

# Part V -- The Quantum Paradigm

Of all the paradigm shifts that science has muddled through, quantum
mechanics has to rank as the most traumatic. It violates our common
sense again and again, and then yet again in some completely new and
unexpected way, constantly challenging rational, logical, fundamental
assumptions about the nature of reality. It challenges *taxonomies*; is
it particle or is it wave? It challenges *observation*; how can it
possibly not have both position and momentum? It challenges
*continuity*; how can it go from here to there yet never be anywhere in
between? It challenges *motion*; what do you mean it took both paths? It
challenges *cause and effect*; how can uncaused causes cause effects to
be random? It challenges *locality*; how can something over there,
spacelike separated, possibly affect something over here? It challenges
*measurement*; don't tell me it ain't until I look at it, what's wrong
with you?

At least games are safe; those delightful mini universes invented by
mere mortals, where we are in complete control of the rules, supreme
despots over structure and strategy; they wouldn't dare undermine our
classical assumptions. We wrote them.

Sigh.

> "No one *understands* quantum mechanics."

--- Richard Feynman

## Quantum Analogs

In the course of this *discovery quest* a few developments hinted at
quantum like behavior in 3D chess. Are these flukes, or portents? The
purpose of this chapter is to broaden our view of the 3D rules in a
deliberate effort to explore the new territory and extend the discovery
quest with a specific objective; how many analogs of quantum concepts
can be found? The rook will be used in most examples as its move is the
clearest and requires less presentation space, but what it reveals
applies to the other pieces as well.

### Loss of Trajectory

The first quantum analog is also the point of departure for the quest to
find the one right rule set that felt like chess; the advancement
square. There is no unique sequence of tiles that gets a piece from one
place to another. It was here, now it's there, and it was never, ever
anywhere in between. One is free to imagine a path, but it is a fiction
and plays no role in the rules. It cannot even be claimed to be a
convenient fiction, for it distorts our understanding of the game.

Figure 232 shows a trivial example of a rook expanding in the horizontal
plane to some arbitrary point on the fourth perimeter. How did it get
there? Did it take every possible route or no route at all? In this rule
space, the very concept of a trajectory is a misnomer. The advancement
square grows one perimeter at-a-time, each larger than the last. That's
all.

Motion is inherently quantum, not classical.

![[]{#_Ref79664974 .anchor}Figure 232: Loss of
Trajectory](media/image233.png){alt="A picture containing text, checker Description automatically generated"
width="4.958333333333333in" height="1.0277777777777777in"}

Black rook expanding into the horizontal plane in a quadrant move to
some arbitrary point (ghost rook) on the fourth perimeter (unadorned
decorators show the 5x5 advancement square). There is simply no unique
sequence of tiles, no path, no trajectory that gets the rook to its
destination. The arrows suggest the permutations; all more or less
equally reasonable, and equally wrong.

### Classical Trajectory

If motion is inherently quantum, not classical, if motion does not
really occur along well-defined trajectories, then why do we perceive
them so readily? They are fundamental to the structure of classical
mechanics, and congruent with our everyday experience and with common
sense.

Consider a slight departure from the formalism of 3D chess and consider
an unreasonably large horizontal plane, 16x16, four times larger than in
the game proper. Let there be a single Black rook and 8 White pawns, so
arrayed that the rook naturally captures them in sequence.

Figure 233 shows this case. The Black rook makes 8 sequential captures.
Whether one looks at the successive positions of the rook, or the
initial positions of the pawns, or even just the tiny advancement
squares themselves; the illusion of a trajectory is compelling.

Kind of looks like tracks in a bubble chamber.

![[]{#_Ref79665765 .anchor}Figure 233: Classical
Trajectory](media/image234.png){alt="A picture containing container Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="1.323611111111111in"}

A Black rook successively captures 8 White pawns on a 16x16 level. The
illusion of a trajectory is the result of many small steps; there is no
trajectory between the source and destination tiles of each small
advancement square, and the sequence of advancement squares is discrete
not continuous, but the temptation to abstract the concept of a
trajectory from such a pattern is nearly irresistible.

The Greek philosophers had arguments that perhaps motion was an
illusion; Zeno's paradox and all. Perhaps it is.

### The Correspondence Principle

Given the strength of the classical paradigm, its seductive pull,
quantum physicists invented the []{#correspondence_principle
.anchor}*correspondence principle*[]{.indexref
entry="correspondence principle:At large enough scale quantum physics converges to classical physics."},
the idea that at large scales, far removed from the quantum realm,
quantum physics should reduce to classical physics, to within some
arbitrary level of precision.

If we zoom out from the previous figure, to say a plane of 32x32 tiles,
we can see the correspondence principle[]{.indexref
entry="correspondence principle:At large enough scale quantum physics converges to classical physics."}
in action. The smaller the tiles, and in particular the smaller the
advancement squares, the stronger the illusion of a trajectory.

Figure 234 shows a Black rook consuming one pawn after another on an
even larger plane. Not only is there the illusion of a trajectory but
look how uniform the motion is. Can the concepts like velocity,
momentum, and inertia be far behind?

![[]{#_Ref79667762 .anchor}Figure 234: Correspondence
Principle](media/image235.png){alt="A picture containing text Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="1.3118055555555554in"}

A Black rook makes steady progress capturing a long sequence of roughly
equally space pawns. The farther away from the quantum realm the more
the system looks classical.

If spacetime is quantized at the Planck scale, that scale corresponds to
the tile size. Collapse is occurring at the scale of the advancement
squares.

### Wave Front

In classical physics we have two major types of things which evolve in
time; particles with their well localized position and momentum, and
waves with their distributed amplitudes.

Figure 235 shows an advancing rook where ghost rooks have been placed on
every other perimeter and the decorators suppressed on the others. The
illusion of a wave is compelling.

![[]{#_Ref79669527 .anchor}Figure 235: Wave
Front](media/image236.png){alt="A picture containing text, building Description automatically generated"
width="4.958333333333333in" height="1.125in"}

Advance of a Black rook where only every other perimeter is shown,
complete with ghost rooks. Such a representation certainly evokes the
concept of an advancing wave front.

In the rules of 3D chess described here, there are no oscillations of
any kind, so the representation of a wave front is a little misleading;
there are no waves, no frequencies, no amplitudes, no velocity of
propagation, and perhaps most significantly, no interference. The only
part of the wave concept that has an analog in 3D chess is the
nonlocalized expanding perimeter in a fuzzily defined direction.
Perhaps.

### Diffraction

There is one sense, however, in which 3D chess does support the physics
concept of a wavelength. Long waves can diffract around small objects
whereas shorter wavelengths cannot. For this analog, the duke will be
contrasted with the rook. Consider a rook making a quadrant advance in
the horizontal plane but limit it to apex tiles. It will be blocked by
any friend piece on the line of apex tiles. Now consider a duke making
the same advance, into an edge quadrant, but our focus here is on the
horizontal level at right angles to the slant plane it is actually
advancing in. A single piece on the line of apex tiles in the horizontal
plane only has a 50% chance of blocking the duke, because in this
direction its perimeter skips every other apex tile.

For the piece to block the duke's advance it must be on an even
perimeter; or with a little license, it must have the right *phase* --
another feature of wave phenomenon. However, if two friend pieces are
adjacent to each other, both on apex tiles, then they form a composite
object, a larger object and now advance of the duke is blocked. Limited
to an orthogonal plane, the duke has a wavelength twice as long as the
rook's; it therefore has a chance to diffract around the smallest chess
object, a single piece.

Figure 236 shows the pair of situations. The line of apex tiles is from
White to Black on the KR level (for the rook) and on the Q level (for
the duke). For both levels, a pawn on the 4,4 tile is the potential
obstacle. The rook is blocked, it can only reach the two apex tiles
prior to the pawn, but the duke is not blocked, it can diffract around
the pawn continuing way past it.

![[]{#_Ref79678668 .anchor}Figure 236:
Diffraction](media/image237.png){alt="Background pattern Description automatically generated"
width="4.958333333333333in" height="6.416666666666667in"}

Considering only the apex tiles in an orthogonal plane when a duke
advances into an edge quadrant, it has a wavelength twice that of the
rook. It can therefore diffract around a single piece if the single
piece is on an odd perimeter (a phase requirement). The KR rook is
blocked from advancing down the apex tiles of its horizontal plane by
the pawn on KR4,4. The Q duke is not blocked from advancing down the
apex tiles of its horizontal plane by the pawn on Q4,4; it can continue
indefinitely. Two pawns on adjacent apex tiles, however, would block it.
Long wavelengths can diffract around small objects.

### Polarization

Another feature of waves is polarization, where there is some particular
direction in space, transverse to the direction of propagation, in which
the amplitude varies. While polarization is present in classical
systems, it is more dramatic in quantum systems since a single object
can be in a superposition[]{.indexref
entry="superposition:A chess piece in multiple tiles at once â super position."}
of multiple polarizations. There is a quantitative difference between a
mixture of objects where each one is in one polarization or the other
(we just don't know which one), and a collection of objects where each
object individually is in a superposition[]{.indexref
entry="superposition:A chess piece in multiple tiles at once â super position."}
of polarizations (can't know).

3D chess sports three analogs of polarization; linear moves, overlap
tiles, and duplex moves.

Figure 237 shows a highly contrived situation with 8 rooks and 8 pawns.
There is one rook and one pawn on every level. In all the levels, the
rook is on one face and its associated pawn is located 4 tiles in. On
every other level, the pawn is directly in front of the rook, a linear
block, so it blocks advance in both horizontal and vertical planes, but
on the other levels, the pawn is one tile off of direct alignment, a
planar block, so it blocks advance in only the horizontal level.

Before encountering the grid of pawns, each rook is advancing in *each*
plane, it is in a *superposition*[]{.indexref
entry="superposition:A chess piece in multiple tiles at once â super position."}
of motion, moving in *both* planes. Half the rooks are blocked at the
grid of pawns. After the grid of pawns, the only rooks to get through
are all advancing solely in the vertical plane -- polarized rooks.

Bishops and dukes also have linear moves. The bishop making a linear
advance is also moving simultaneously in two planes, and so can be
polarized in either, just like the rook, and both make close analogs
with physical polarization. The duke, however, moves in three planes
when making a linear advance. The possible polarization superpositions
of the duke are therefore richer, and to my knowledge, have no
corresponding example in physics. The duke can be in a full
superposition[]{.indexref
entry="superposition:A chess piece in multiple tiles at once â super position."}
of all three planes, or a dual superposition[]{.indexref
entry="superposition:A chess piece in multiple tiles at once â super position."}
of 3 different pairs of planes, or in a single superposition[]{.indexref
entry="superposition:A chess piece in multiple tiles at once â super position."}[^60]
(there's an odd phrase), anyone of the 3 planes. Counting being fully
blocked as a special null case of polarization, the duke has 8 possible
states, the bishop & rook only 4.

The queen provides the second example of polarization because of those
overlap tiles, places the queen can advance to as more than one type of
base piece. Instead of being in a superposition[]{.indexref
entry="superposition:A chess piece in multiple tiles at once â super position."}
of planes, she is in a superposition[]{.indexref
entry="superposition:A chess piece in multiple tiles at once â super position."}
of base pieces. A queen making a linear rook advance is also, on every
other tile, making a duke duplex advance. She is oscillating (square
wave like) between a pure rook, and a superposition[]{.indexref
entry="superposition:A chess piece in multiple tiles at once â super position."}
of a rook and a duke. Closest analog in physics might be the neutrino
which oscillates between the three types (electron, muon, tau) as it
travels.

![[]{#_Ref79742455 .anchor}Figure 237: Polarization of Linear Rook
Moves](media/image238.png){alt="Background pattern Description automatically generated"
width="4.958333333333333in" height="7.458333333333333in"}

Every other rook is linear blocked from making a linear move by a pawn,
the other 4 rooks are only planar blocked in the horizontal planes.
Before the grid of pawns, every rook is in a superposition[]{.indexref
entry="superposition:A chess piece in multiple tiles at once â super position."}
of advancing in both a horizontal and a vertical plane. After the grid
of pawns, the remaining rooks are all advancing in vertical planes only
-- polarized rooks. Ghost pieces indicate the transmitted rooks.

The duke provides a third example of superposition[]{.indexref
entry="superposition:A chess piece in multiple tiles at once â super position."}.
When it advances in a face quadrant, the apex tiles of the individual
advancement squares overlap between the pair of cross planes[]{.indexref
entry="cross planes:Duke planes come in planes connecting opposing board faces."};
that's why they are called duplex tiles. From the perspective of the
duplex tiles, the duke is advancing in both cross planes[]{.indexref
entry="cross planes:Duke planes come in planes connecting opposing board faces."}.
Here is a superposition[]{.indexref
entry="superposition:A chess piece in multiple tiles at once â super position."}
of motion that is not a linear move.

Figure 238 shows an example of a single duke on the KR level advancing
vertically downward along a line of duplex tiles. For the first two
duplex tiles, the duke is unblocked in both the major and minor planes,
but after that, the bishop on the king level is blocking advance in the
minor plane. Before the bishop, the duke is in a duplex
superposition[]{.indexref
entry="superposition:A chess piece in multiple tiles at once â super position."},
a superposition[]{.indexref
entry="superposition:A chess piece in multiple tiles at once â super position."}
of a pair of cross planes[]{.indexref
entry="cross planes:Duke planes come in planes connecting opposing board faces."},
but after the bishop, it is advancing only in the major plane -- a
polarized duke. This is not a linear move; the duke has two ways of
producing analogs with polarization.

It is possible to place several dukes on the board and block half of
them as was done in the rook example, but the figure becomes so busy
that perceiving the polarization pattern is untenable.

![[]{#_Ref79745679 .anchor}Figure 238: Polarization of Duke Duplex
Moves](media/image239.png){alt="Background pattern Description automatically generated"
width="4.958333333333333in" height="7.291666666666667in"}

Dukes can also be polarized in their duplex moves. In this example, a
single duke is advancing downward to a succession of duplex tiles.
Before the bishop on the king level, the duke's move is unblocked in
both the major and minor planes; its advance is in a
superposition[]{.indexref
entry="superposition:A chess piece in multiple tiles at once â super position."}
of a pair of cross planes[]{.indexref
entry="cross planes:Duke planes come in planes connecting opposing board faces."}.
This is not a linear move. After the bishop, the duke is advancing only
in the major plane -- it has become polarized. Ghost dukes indicated the
successive moves.

### Superposition

Obviously, superposition[]{.indexref
entry="superposition:A chess piece in multiple tiles at once â super position."}
plays a role in polarization, a superposition[]{.indexref
entry="superposition:A chess piece in multiple tiles at once â super position."}
of planes or base pieces, but 3D chess offers an additional analog for
superposition[]{.indexref
entry="superposition:A chess piece in multiple tiles at once â super position."}
that more closely aligns with its namesake; super -- position. Let a
piece advance, one perimeter at-a-time. On each successive perimeter,
the possible locations for the piece to conclude its move is the set of
tiles on that perimeter. Without knowing the external details, each tile
on the final perimeter is just as likely as any other.

In the context of 3D chess, a move is an instantaneous event. The piece
was here, now it's there. But the process of determining the legality of
a move requires consideration of the advance as a sequence of
perimeters, and any occupied tile, on any perimeter, halts the advance.
In some sense, the piece is []{#sniffing .anchor}*sniffing*[]{.indexref
entry="sniffing:Simultaneously testing multiple paths for ârunning into something.â"}
out the environment, one perimeter at-a-time, sensing when it has 'run
into something' and when it does, further progress is halted.

Conceptually, during an advance, or at least during the consideration of
an advance, a piece is in a superposition[]{.indexref
entry="superposition:A chess piece in multiple tiles at once â super position."}.

During play, tactics and strategy drive how likely any particular move
is, so assigning a probability to each tile on a perimeter is context
sensitive. But given an arbitrary and unknown external environment, the
best one could say is that the probability of ending up on each tile is
roughly equally likely.

Figure 239 shows an example of a rook advancing to perimeter 4. Ghost
rooks are on the perimeter of the pure advancement square showing a
7-way superposition[]{.indexref
entry="superposition:A chess piece in multiple tiles at once â super position."}.

![[]{#_Ref79747476 .anchor}Figure 239: Superposition on Perimeter
Tiles](media/image240.png){alt="A picture containing text, checker, roulette Description automatically generated"
width="4.958333333333333in" height="1.0277777777777777in"}

The advancement square rule of 3D chess places a piece during its
advance in a superposition[]{.indexref
entry="superposition:A chess piece in multiple tiles at once â super position."}
of all the tiles on the final perimeter. All things being equal this
superposition[]{.indexref
entry="superposition:A chess piece in multiple tiles at once â super position."}
is equally weighted. Ghost rooks show the tiles in the
superposition[]{.indexref
entry="superposition:A chess piece in multiple tiles at once â super position."}.

### Collapse

When a player develops a piece, they are seeking the most advantageous
tile to place it on. For the move to be legal, of course, the final
perimeter, and all the earlier ones, must be empty. Now the player must
choose which of the tiles on the final perimeter are the strongest.
There may be one tile that is clearly superior, or there may be more
than one, and in edge cases they might all be equally valid. In either
case, the player has to make a choice to reduce the
superposition[]{.indexref
entry="superposition:A chess piece in multiple tiles at once â super position."}
implied by the perimeter to a single tile; to, if you will, collapse the
superposition[]{.indexref
entry="superposition:A chess piece in multiple tiles at once â super position."}.

Figure 240 shows an example where only the decorators for the source
tile and the final perimeter are shown. Six ghost rooks are shown with
far more transparency than usual (think of them as blinking out of
existence), while the seventh rook is solid; it represents the tile the
rook's superposition move is collapsing to. The tile of the rook's
original position is indicated with the source decorator (2,2).

![[]{#_Ref79756834 .anchor}Figure 240: Collapse to One
Tile](media/image241.png){alt="A screenshot of a computer game Description automatically generated with low confidence"
width="4.958333333333333in" height="1.0277777777777777in"}

Amongst all the tiles of the final perimeter, the player must choose
just one, collapsing the superposition[]{.indexref
entry="superposition:A chess piece in multiple tiles at once â super position."}
(poltergeist rooks) to one specific tile (solid rook). The rook is no
longer on the source tile.

### Probabilities

In quantum physics, superposition[]{.indexref
entry="superposition:A chess piece in multiple tiles at once â super position."}
is not typically weighted equally. In 3D chess, there are no explicit
weights, the odds of a move are driven by tactics, strategy, and the
player's skill. Still, with a little imagination, and a slight variation
in the rules, we can construct a modified advance rule which generates
weighted superpositions and thus an analog for probabilities of
collapse.

Let's consider a balance rule, where the blocking rule by advancement
square is broadened. Being good physicists, the time asymmetric nature
of trapdoor moves is, well, just not professional. We are going to
eliminate that loophole in the laws of chess physics by disallowing
moves that are not time symmetric. If the piece cannot return to its
original position in one move, under the state of the board at the time
it advanced, then the move is not legal. This means the advanced and
[]{#retarded .anchor}*retarded*[]{.indexref
entry="retarded:Alternate (and suggestive) name for the retreat advancement square."}[^61]
advancement squares must both be empty.[^62] For apex moves, these two
advancement squares always overlay each other completely, so apex moves
are always legal if the forward advancement square is unblocked.
However, as one considers between tiles increasingly further removed
from the apex tile, the number of tiles in the retarded[]{.indexref
entry="retarded:Alternate (and suggestive) name for the retreat advancement square."}
advancement square that do not overlay the forward one grows. This
increases the chances that some third piece will block the return, and
thus under this imaginative rule, block the forward move.

The effect is to produce a probability curve, symmetric but not
Gaussian, centered on the apex tile. Superposition with probabilities --
an even better analog.

Figure 241 shows an example with the time symmetric balance rule in
effect. The rook can safely advance to the apex tile and both adjacent
between tiles, i.e., it can retreat from them to its original source
tile in just one move. But the knights block the retarded[]{.indexref
entry="retarded:Alternate (and suggestive) name for the retreat advancement square."}
advancement squares for all the other tiles on the perimeter. Instead of
being in a superposition[]{.indexref
entry="superposition:A chess piece in multiple tiles at once â super position."}
of all 7 tiles on the pure perimeter, the rook is only in a
superposition[]{.indexref
entry="superposition:A chess piece in multiple tiles at once â super position."}
of 3 of them. They are marked with ghost rooks.

![[]{#_Ref79758426 .anchor}Figure 241: Weighted Probabilities for
Perimeter Tiles with the Time Symmetric Balance
Rule](media/image242.png){alt="A picture containing text, checker Description automatically generated"
width="4.958333333333333in" height="1.5138888888888888in"}

To get weighted superpositions, a balance rule is invoked; let advance
be blocked not only by the forward advancement square but also by the
retarded[]{.indexref
entry="retarded:Alternate (and suggestive) name for the retreat advancement square."}
advancement square. Then the odds that an advance is blocked depends on
how far the perimeter tile is from the apex tile. In this example, the
forward advance of the Black rook is shown in red, as are the two
retarded[]{.indexref
entry="retarded:Alternate (and suggestive) name for the retreat advancement square."}
advancement squares blocked by the knights (transparent). One is shown
above the plane, and one in the plane, to provide a more complete
picture. Given a random distribution of other pieces in the plane, the
superposition[]{.indexref
entry="superposition:A chess piece in multiple tiles at once â super position."}
is now unevenly weighted; peaked at the apex tile and decreasing as each
successive perimeter tile is farther away. The change in probabilities
is hinted at by the limited number of ghost rooks centered around the
apex tile.

### Wave-Particle Duality

In 3D chess, a piece can be a target, an obstacle, or an object to be
moved. As a target or an obstacle, only it's location matters and it is
treated like a particle, with a highly localized and well-defined
position. When it comes time to move it however, it must be treated more
like a wave (in the partial sense described above). Whether a move is
legal, trapdoor, or blockable, a piece's advance and potential retreat
cannot be treated as point like, it is distributed.

Figure 242 shows a bishop blocked by the rook; in this context the rook
is particle like. It also shows the rook's advance blocked by a knight;
in this context the rook is a wave. Wave-particle duality in chess --
who would have thought?

![[]{#_Ref79760738 .anchor}Figure 242: Wave-Particle
Duality](media/image243.png){alt="A picture containing text Description automatically generated"
width="4.958333333333333in" height="1.0277777777777777in"}

3D chess requires us to regard pieces as particle-like in some
circumstances, the rook (point like) is blocking the bishop, but as
wave-like in others, the rook's advance (distributed) is blocked by the
knight.

### Fermion-Boson Distinction

When considering coverage in chess, the possibility of several pieces
converging on a single tile requires the analysis of whether or not they
can reach that tile. Do the various advancement manifolds extend all the
way to that tile?

In a software implementation of 3D chess, it would be useful to know how
many advancement manifolds impinge upon it. The tile object should of
course know whether it is empty or occupied, but it should also know
what advancement manifolds can reach it, that is, what pieces are
covering it. Let each tile contain a list of references to the impinging
advancement manifolds. That's a very awkward phrase, so let's shorten it
to []{#imp .anchor}*imp*[]{.indexref
entry="imp:Short for âimpinging advancement squares or rectangles.â"},
for 'impinging.'

The greater the number of imps the more heavily a particular tile is
defended, or attacked, depending on the player's point of view.

A tile can hold at most one piece, but it can hold an almost unlimited
number of imps (up to the number of pieces on the board). Or put another
way, pieces are *excluded* from occupying the same state, but imps are
not. In quantum physics, there is the Pauli exclusion principle;
multiple fermions (electrons, protons, etc.) are prohibited from
occupying the same state. For bosons there is no limit.

Pieces are like fermions; imps are like bosons.

The analogy is actually even stronger. Bosons *mediate* the interactions
between fermions; imps (i.e. the impinging advancement squares and
rectangles) *mediate* the interactions between pieces.

Figure 243 shows four minor pieces all covering KB3,3. No tile may
contain more than one piece, but any tile may contain multiple imps. As
we've used them here, tile decorators are incomplete imps, their color
indicates only the type of piece which has an advancement manifold that
can reach that tile; to deduce the particular piece, one must trace the
advancement manifold back to its source. White's king bishop 3,3 tile
contains four decorators (indicating four imps), one for each covering
piece (rook, bishop, duke, & knight).

![[]{#_Ref79761232 .anchor}Figure 243: Pieces as Fermions, Advancement
Manifolds as
Bosons.](media/image244.png){alt="Shape, background pattern Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="7.276388888888889in"}

Two pieces are excluded from being in the same tile; they are fermionic.
But there is no limit for the number of decorators, proxies for *imps*
(impinging advancement manifolds) which a tile may hold; they are
bosonic. In this example, the rook, bishop, duke and knight are all
covering the KB3,3 tile. The decorators on that tile have been
vertically separated to show them all. Like bosons mediate the forces
between fermions, imps mediate the interactions between pieces.

### Decay

A good analogy should contain an element of surprise, like the previous
one; advancement squares are boson like, it is they which mediate the
interactions between pieces, which are fermion like. Didn't see that one
coming. Given that the stack is the only composite piece on the 3D board
and given that it doesn't even exist as a piece in 2D, the analogy with
particle decay seems a little too convenient. However, looking below the
surface does reveal some nuances that might escape notice on a first
pass.

For instance, some heavy nuclei have multiple decay modes. For instance,
the shorter-lived isomer of Es254 (TÂ½ 39 hrs.) has four decay modes;
spontaneous fission, gamma ray, beta decay ($\beta$-decay), and alpha
decay ($\alpha$-decay).[^63] Neutrons don't; out comes a proton, an
electron, and anti-neutrino every time. The stack has three decay modes;
fission, bishop decay (b-decay), and duke decay (d-decay).[^64]

The behavior of the composite piece is dramatically different than its
decay sub-pieces; the stack, as a stack, moves in a very halting, sparse
way, while the bishop moves smoothly in skew planes and the duke moves
in a skipping fashion in slant planes. Protons (positively charged) and
electrons (negatively charged) move nothing like a neutron (neutral
charge) in the presence of an electric or magnetic field.

### Half-Life of Stacks for Random Legal Moves

Imagine a science experiment on the 3D chess board. A lone stack is
placed on one of the 8 center tiles. From there it can access 147 tiles
via bishop decay, and 115 tiles via duke decay of which 27 are common to
both, for a total of 235 tiles. Now randomly select one of those 235
tiles. For 27 of them, the stack can move as a stack. For the purpose of
this analogy, we shall require that if it can move as stack, it must
move as a stack; thus, for these 27 tiles, it does not decay. For 120 of
them it can only move as a bishop, in which case it undergoes bishop
decay, and for 88 of them it can only move as a duke, in which case it
undergoes duke decay.

It is more likely to decay than to move as a stack, and more likely to
undergo a bishop decay than a duke decay. Two decay modes with different
probabilities.

Consider a thousand 3D chess boards setup with a single stack on a
center tile and for each board a random selection is made from amongst
the 235 legal moves. The odds of decay (we'll ignore fission) are then
(235-27)/235 = 88.5%. In the half-life equation, this value is given the
symbol $\lambda$ (lambda).

Equation

$$T_{1/2} = \ln(2)/\lambda$$

Cleary the number of intact stacks after each move is proportional to
the number of intact stacks at the start of the move, and the odds of
decay are constant and independent of the number of stacks. Therefore,
stack decay follows a half-life curve.

The half-life of a stack under these conditions is thus 0.783 moves. Do
note, however, that trying to model this decay on a move by move basis
is subject to quantization error since the half-life is on the scale of
a single move and will result in a steeper decline.

So, 3 moves =\> about 4 half-lives, or 16 stacks dwindle to 1 in 3
moves.

### Time Symmetry

In general, the basic laws of physics are time symmetric. Not so much
for games. Most popular human invented games make very poor models of
time symmetric rules. Chess is one of the few exceptions. True, the pawn
move is not symmetric, neither are promotion, en passant, castling, and
capture, but they all involve multiple pieces.

It was noted early on that marking all the tiles any one base piece can
reach in one move on an empty board is exactly the same set of tiles
from which it had to come from on the previous move. The base piece
moves are time symmetric, and they are fundamental components of how all
the other pieces move. If we wish to find analogs in chess to violations
of time symmetry in physics, then we need to focus our attention on the
time reversible base piece moves.

Figure 244 shows the time symmetries of the base piece moves for a White
queen on a center tile (Q4,4), limited to one plane per base piece for
clarity. In each of the planes shown (left vertical for the rook, upward
for the bishop, and major for the duke), the decorated tiles are the
only tiles the queen can reach in each of the planes on her next move
and are also, exactly, the only tiles she could have come from within
that plane on the previous move. Obviously, the time symmetry applies to
all 3 rook planes, all 4 bishop planes, and all 6 duke planes. The
planes are shown out to perimeter 4. However, most of the perimeter 4
and some of the perimeter 3 tiles for the bishop are off the board (not
shown). The duke is even worse, all but one perimeter 4 tile is off the
board (the Black KR1,1 tile).

This is a good figure for reviewing the four *overlap* tiles. All the
rook apex moves are also bishop linear moves for the queen. All the
bishop linear moves are alternating *brook* and q-tiles for the queen.
Every duke apex move is also a *q-tile* for the queen. Every other rook
linear move, and every duke duplex move is a *hotspot* tile for the
queen. Finally, every other bishop apex tile is a *Feynman* tile for the
queen.

![[]{#_Ref79846161 .anchor}Figure 244: Time Symmetry,
Queen](media/image245.png){alt="Shape Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="7.276388888888889in"}

Since base piece moves are time symmetric, so are all the queen moves.
For clarity, only one plane of each base piece is shown. In each plane,
the set of tiles the queen can reach on the next move is precisely the
same set of tiles she had to come from within that plane on the previous
move. Note the many overlap tiles. While every decorator is bordered in
purple, the interior colors code for which base piece moves can reach
that tile; red for rook, green for bishop, and blue for duke.

### The Arrow of Time

Given that the laws of physics are time symmetric, it is a bit of a
mystery why time seems to flow in only one direction; why is the past
fixed but the future open? This is referred to as the arrow of time
problem. This is really an interesting analog for quantum physics only
for the time symmetry base piece moves, as chess has many rules which
violate time symmetry. In 2D chess, the base pieces, and all others
except the pawn advance in a time symmetric manner. In 3D, this symmetry
is violated by the trapdoor move, where some other piece prevents a full
retreat to the source tile in just one move.

Figure 245 shows a trapdoor move. If the White rook moves so as to peek
around its pawn, it will have a one-way attack on its pawn, but it won't
be able to return to its source tile in one move. The presence of the
pawn has broken time symmetry.

![[]{#_Ref79793942 .anchor}Figure 245: Time Symmetry
Violation](media/image246.png){alt="A picture containing text, dish, checker Description automatically generated"
width="6.458333333333333in" height="3.9027777777777777in"}

White desires to move his rook so as to peek around the pawn in a
one-way attack on Black's rook (a). While the peek works (b), it is a
trapdoor move for White, as his rook can no longer return to his
original tile in one move (c).

In general, a third piece can break the time symmetry of base piece
moves; a capture is not required. 3D chess demonstrates an arrow of
time, even without captures, pawn advances, promotion, en passant or
castling.

In one case it is one move to advance, two to retreat; in the other it
is two moves to advance, one to retreat. 3D chess violates time symmetry
even though the base rules are time symmetric. This is true for all the
base pieces, plus the queen and stack. The knight's move is not an
advance, so it is fully time symmetric, and only the king's bishop move
is not time symmetric. The pawn, of course, given that is has
restrictions on direction, is clearly not time symmetric, but it is
interesting to note in passing that it is the lack of space symmetry
that is the source of the time asymmetry, since its move is based on the
moves of the base pieces.

### CPT[]{.indexref entry="CPT:Acronym for charge conjugation, parity, and time symmetry."}

A good analogy should contain an element of surprise; you might have
heard that somewhere. It is time to consider the pawn, but for brevities
sake we'll just focus on its advance and limit it to single size
advances. The White pawns advance in one direction, and the Black pawns
advance in the opposite direction, 180Â° opposed.

The pawn is the only piece which has a restriction on direction and the
direction to which the pawn is restricted depends on the color of the
pawn. Now by a happy coincidence, the English words 'color' and 'charge'
both start with the letter 'C'. Or to put it pithily, the pawn is the
only piece which feels the *color* force.

If a pawn changes color, it is now moving in the opposite direction; the
pawn violates *color* invariance.

If the board is reflected through a minor plane an advancing pawn is
moving in the opposite direction; the pawn violates *parity* invariance.

If the past and future are swapped, the pawn is again moving in the
opposite direction; the pawn violates *time* invariance.

In physics these are referred to as charge conjugation, parity and time
symmetry, *CPT*[]{.indexref
entry="CPT:Acronym for charge conjugation, parity, and time symmetry."}
for short.[^65]

If the color of the pawns is reversed *and* the board is mirrored, pawn
advances will not change. The pawn violates parity invariance, and the
pawn violates color invariance, but if both are changed at once, the
pawn cannot be used to detect this change. The pawn obeys CP invariance.

If the color of the pawns is reversed *and* time is reversed, pawn
advances will not change. The pawn violates parity invariance, and it
violates time symmetry, but if both are changed at once, the pawn cannot
be used to detect this change. The pawn obeys CT invariance.

If the board is mirrored (or even just rotated 180Â°) *and* time is
reversed, pawn advance will not change. The pawn violates parity, and it
violates time symmetry, but if both are changed at once, the pawn cannot
be used to detect this change. The pawn obeys PT invariance.

But is the pawn the only piece that obeys these product invariance
conditions?

Consider a rook orbiting a pawn in a horizontal level. There are no
tactics or strategy to this scenario, it is being considered solely for
its ability to reveal one more analog with quantum physics.

Figure 246 shows the scenario in 4 snapshots. The White rook is orbiting
the White pawn in the counterclockwise direction, advancing to a between
tile on the 3^rd^ perimeter of a 4x4 advancement square. It starts one
rank and two files off the pawn (a 2D knights move). It takes the rook 4
moves to orbit the pawn in this direction.

However, each and every one of these moves is a trapdoor move. It
therefore would take the rook 8 moves to orbit the pawn in the opposite
direction. An orbiting rook violates parity; it also violates time
symmetry. Therefore, if both the direction of the orbital motion and the
clock are reversed there will appear to be no change in the motion of
the rook. An orbiting rook obeys PT invariance.[^66]

![[]{#_Ref79793954 .anchor}Figure 246: An Orbiting Rook Obeys PT
Invariance](media/image247.png){alt="A picture containing diagram Description automatically generated"
width="6.458333333333333in" height="5.333333333333333in"}

A rook can orbit a pawn in 4 moves counterclockwise (a-d), but it would
take 8 moves to do so clockwise. Note how successive moves of the rook
are always in a 2D knight's move in relation to the pawn. But that's
only four tiles, and a 2D knight can attack eight. Start the rook on one
of the other four 'knight' tiles, and the situation is reversed. Now the
rook can orbit the pawn in 4 moves clockwise, but it will take 8 moves
to orbit counterclockwise. In both cases, reversing the direction of the
orbit (parity) and reversing the clock (time) changes nothing. An
orbiting rook obeys PT invariance.

### Review

It is surprising how often the initial direction of an adventure shifts
in the course of a quest. Our goal was to find the *one right rule set*
that led to play in three dimensions that *felt like chess*, with a
solemn covenant to pursue *discovery*, resist the temptation of
*invention*, maintain a critical suspicion of *paradigms* so they would
not be obstacles to a careful choice of which *invariants* to honor and
which to shun.

Finding 16 analogs between 3D chess and quantum physics is
interesting,[^67] but there are many fundamental quantum mechanical
features that didn't make the list. One question is why the list is
incomplete, but that is another research topic. The burning question is
why any quantum analogs at all? Wasn't our expectation that all games
are inherently classical? That's the surprise.

Finding a gold nugget in a stream will not on its own make you rich but
backtrack upstream far enough and one may find a trail of gold nuggets
that lead to the mother lode.

The extreme counterintuitive nature of quantum physics implies that our
most fundamental modes of thinking are at odds with reality. Perhaps we
should invest in backtracking that trail; not in search of gold nuggets,
but in search of better ways of thinking. Can we improve our ability to
think out of the box?

Let us, therefore, review our quest, from start to finish. Can we
abstract the tips, tricks and techniques that invited us to shun
invariants of 2D chess which had stood sacrosanct for hundreds of years?

## Degenerate Invariants

Let us imagine that 'chess' is a meta game playable in any dimension,
well, any integral dimension.[^68] Chess in two dimensions is one
abstraction of this meta game, the one we are all familiar with. Chess
in three dimensions is another, higher abstraction of this game, a
higher resolution abstraction that reveals more of the nuances implicit
in the meta game. The congruent rules of chess captured in Appendix I is
an attempt to formalize this idea of 'chess' as a meta game.

The coupling between these two abstractions are the degenerate
invariants. An invariant is just some aspect of a system that is stable
and unchanging while all around it change is happening. The bishop
provides a convenient example; if it starts on a white tile, it will
always be on a white tile; that's an invariant. A degenerate invariant
is where two or more invariants are equivalent in one abstraction but
different in another. Such invariants tend to pair up.

In this approach to 3D chess, the fundamental degenerate invariant was
the geometry of a base piece move; did pieces move in straight lines, or
did they move in a space one dimension less than the board? In 2D, these
two invariants are degenerate; they prescribe equivalent behavior. In
3D, they are not degenerate; they prescribe very different behavior,
planar moves instead of straight lines moves. The higher abstraction
breaks the degeneracy. In physics, this kind of thing is called symmetry
breaking, and degeneracy is one form of symmetry.

For each pair of degenerate invariants, a choice must be made, and each
choice leads to a different game. Some of these games turn out to be
rather lame; no one pursues them further, they form a kind of background
to what we mean by a good game; playable, winnable, intricacies emerging
from a few simple rules, etc. Many combinations of these choices do lead
to interesting games, but it is rather subjective whether these games
come under the umbrella of *feels like chess*, or whether it is more
credible to ask them to stand on their own, as original creations
inspired by chess, but not really in the family.

Our intent was to carefully sift through the degenerate invariants
trying to make the selections that led as much as possible to a game
that felt like chess. While specific criteria were laid out to make this
goal as objective as possible, the subjective element could not be
completely eliminated. Some of the rules considered and tossed out, like
the RAM rule, lead to games much easier to play.

Unknown at the start of this quest was whether such a rule set would be
unique, or if a whole family of games might lay equal claim to being
chess in three dimensions. We chose the audacious aim of *one right rule
set*, more as a discipline to maintain the focus on discovery and reject
the temptation of invention, than as a true expectation. Even 2D chess
went through a period where the agreed upon rules were in flux.

So, let's review the choices that were made with two aims in mind; any
interesting games show up along the way, and are there any choices that
lead to competing claims to being 3D chess? Just because our objective
was *feels like chess*, doesn't mean we can't get excited about finding
some interesting not quite chess game along the way, and just because we
hoped for *one right rule set* doesn't mean we will find more than one
solution that meets our objective criteria. Perhaps the true state of
affairs is that there are many versions of 3D chess.

### Straight Line Moves versus Moves in a Space One Dimension Less than the Board

Do pieces move in straight lines, or in a space one dimension less than
the board?

The recognition of the need for planar moves to preserve the endgames is
the launch point of this version of 3D chess. A second reason for
preferring planes to lines was that the base pieces would require
*three* straight-line moves to reach any of their reachable tiles versus
*two* planar moves. This preserved the 2D invariant that all base pieces
could reach their domains in just two moves.

### Paths versus Rectangular Advancement Manifolds (RAM)

Do pieces move in paths, or are they trajectory free?

In all other games where pieces move and their movement can be blocked
by other pieces, pieces move in lines, they may be straight, jagged, or
curved lines, but they all have trajectories, a well-defined sequence of
intermediate locations. The RAM rule specified a two-dimensional array
of tiles which had to be empty for a move to be blocked. This preserved
the 2D invariant that a single piece can block an attack.

### RAM versus Advancement Squares

Is a move guided by two independent rays, or by rays of the same length?

The RAM rule was easy to visualize, but it allowed any piece to make the
first move of the game, completely upending the feel of openings. The
consequence of this choice is the advancement square, and many of the
quantum analogs stem from this choice.

Given the ease of visualization, and the avoidance of peeking, trapdoor
moves, mutual blocks/pins, quiet blocks, stonewall blocks, snapdragons,
etc., there is a playability argument against this choice.

### Tri-level Board versus Regular Array of Regular Things

Is the chess board composed of squares, or a regular array of regular
things?

If the 2D board is a square of squares, then the 3D board should be a
cube of cubes, and the 4D board a hypercube of hypercubes, etc. etc.
etc. Three level boards need not apply.

### Rook & Bishop versus N Base Pieces

Are there two base pieces, or one base piece for each dimension?

This led to the duke. Whether the duke is allowed on the board or not,
it affects the definitions of the queen, knight, pawn, and king.

### Variable Edge Size versus a Fixed Edge Size of 8

Does the length of an edge of the board depend on the dimension, or is
it fixed at 8?

Larger boards tend to degenerate into a major piece war followed by a
pawn war; neither openings nor the midgame felt like chess. However, a
10x10x10 board avoids the need for the stack, and if the pawn is allowed
to keep its full 3D nature, that is if it is allowed its predator, bead
and most especially its dart attacks, then this strategic split in the
game is minimized. The price, however, is a board twice as large; 1,000
tiles versus 512, in a game already very complex. And while not a
practical matter, extending to 12x12x12x12 board for 4D chess pretty
much destroys the scalability of the congruent rules of chess and
undermines the idea of 'chess' as a meta game.

### Iconoclastic Pieces versus Composite Pieces

Must pieces be iconoclastic, or can they be composite?

This choice allows the stack as a solution to having real dukes on the
board while limiting the board size to 8x8x8. However, allowing the
stack to move like *either* bishop or duke violated the invariants that
base pieces should stay on their own colors, where allowing it to only
move like bishop *and* duke reduced its power projection to negligible
levels. This led to decay moves. There are lots of potential balance
rules here. The choice was made to select for the most permissive rules
allowing players to play more conservative games without interference
from whatever computer program they used to play the game.

### Quadrants versus Linear Moves

Is a piece moving in multiple quadrants unblocked by any empty quadrant,
or blocked by any occupied quadrant, or unblocked by pairs of quadrants
in the same plane?

This is one example where the degenerate invariants can't be reduced to
pairs. The last option leads to advancement rectangles and to the linear
move which preserves the 2D invariant that advancement manifolds (lines,
planes, hypersurfaces, etc.) are independent of each other. It also
leads to some of the hardest situations to visualize correctly; quiet
and stonewall blocks for instance.

### Knights as Sequential Jumps versus Anti Queens

Is the knight move an additive composition of base pieces, or a
subtractive one?

In 2D, the knight move can be described as one tile like a rook and one
tile like a bishop, or vice-a-versa. This is a weak specification, for
it implies the knight can be blocked when in fact it jumps. Worse it
doesn't extend to 3D, even when restricted to the top two base pieces,
for now order is important; one tile as duke, then one tile as bishop,
but the reverse order doesn't work. If the knight moves as a combination
of all three base pieces, then its range is extended breaking the
pawn-knight endgame races, and it no longer projects the right 2D knight
move. In contrast, specification as the anti-queen constrains its range
correctly, projects correctly, and implies jumping implicitly. However,
it also leads to the knight being unable to protect the royal pawns in
the opening.

### Restricted Pawns versus Perimeter 1 Pawns

Are pawns prohibited from capturing *to* rook tiles, or merely
prohibited from capturing *like* rooks?

This is an example of a []{#null_rule .anchor}*null rule*[]{.indexref
entry="null rule:A rule unnecessary to write down, for it has no affect in an abstraction."}.
In 2D, pawns advance like a rook and capture like a bishop, with no
tiles in common. It is therefore unnecessary to *assert* that pawns may
not capture to tiles they can also reach as a rook, for in 2D there are
none. A null rule[]{.indexref
entry="null rule:A rule unnecessary to write down, for it has no affect in an abstraction."}
has no effect, like prepending a bunch of zeros to an integer (000549),
it doesn't change the value. Therefore, most null rules are never
written down; in some epistemological sense they don't even exist at the
lower abstraction level. However, at the higher-level abstraction they
do exist, and one has to choose between them. We chose to let the pawn
express its full 3D nature, keeping the predator, bead and dart attacks.

I'm greatly bothered by pawns capturing on their own level, it doesn't
feel like chess to me, and its impact[]{.indexref
entry="impact:Measures of a pieceâs ability to affect the game; range, PPR, & stab."}
on openings is significant, but it seems premature to decide the issue
on *feelings*; this is what the concepts of base pieces and planar moves
led to. To arbitrarily restrict this is to abandon our commitment to
discovery and succumb to the temptation of invention.

Therefore, in this case also, the choice was made to select for the most
permissive rules allowing players to play more conservative games with
as little interference as possible from whatever computer program they
use to play the game.

This one should really be decided only by countless hours of play. But
of all the rules proposed here, with the intent to yield play that
*feels like chess*, this is the first one I'd let go of.

### Simple Pawns versus Shackled Pawns

Must pawns promote in one step, or is partial promotion allowed?

When upgrading the chess board from a square of squares to a cube of
cubes, the board goes from having two features (sides and corners) to
having three (faces, edges and vertices). In 2D, the pawns promote on
any tile on the opposite *side*. Should this mean they promote in 3D on
the opposite face, or opposite edge, or perhaps both? Does side promote
to face or to edge? There is no uniform answer, it depends on the
circumstances. Some 3D chess variations pile up 128 pieces on opposite
faces of the board. Their choice was to promote side to face.

We chose to keep the same number of pieces and start them on opposite
edges. This strongly suggests that the best answer is that promotion
occurs on the opposite edge, but that led to promotion molasses; where
it could take a pawn *twelve* moves to promote. There went the mid game
and many endgames as well.

An alternative was to allow promotion on the back faces of the board.
This encouraged broader pawn walls and helped preserve the feel of
openings but trying to defend against pawn promotion where pawns could
be widely separated in *two* dimensions seemed problematical for both
midgame and endgames.

The compromise we selected was shackled pawns. This still encouraged
broader pawn walls, and reduced the dual dimension dilemma for the
defender, but it smacks of invention. Some clever word play framed this
rule in the medieval motif, the peasants yearning to be free and all,
but that is using words for persuasion, not argument.

I wish I had stronger arguments for shackled pawns, but it really comes
down to intuition, instinct and insight whether this rule will travel
well. Time will tell.

There are three places where this proposed 3D rule set is susceptible to
easy criticism; the stack, pawns capturing on their own level, and
shackled pawns. The rest of the rules are solid; they at least have a
solid claim on the objective of finding the *one right rule set*.

### Fictitious Chess Moves versus Atomic Chess Moves

Can compound moves be decomposed, or are chess moves atomic?

This mostly applied to castling, where the pejorative description
'supernatural' was used, but it is very consistent with the loss of
trajectory. The rules specify *preconditions* and *post conditions*, and
anything that happens in between is outside the rules. Moves in chess
are atomic.

### King Moves to Adjacent Tiles versus King Makes Linear Moves to Perimeter 1

Does the king move to adjacent tiles, or does it move like a short-range
queen?

Does the king move like a short-range queen, or does it make linear
moves to perimeter 1?

This was a tough rule to discover; slippery little bastard. Here is
another example of a triplet of degenerate rules[]{.indexref
entry="degenerate rules:Equivalent in a lower abstraction but different in a higher abstraction."}.
While the king's power projection plummets in 3D chess, its degrees of
freedom explode; hemming in the king was going to be very difficult
under the first option making midgame mates almost impossible. However,
the second option, letting it move to perimeter 1 like a short-range
queen, allowed the king to penetrate rook and dual bishop walls, and
double its speed, which were devastating to the endgame. Neither was
going to feel like chess.

The king is still the only piece that can be blocked by pieces on tiles
it cannot reach. Handicapping the pawn, depending on the exact
restrictions, would likely add the pawn to this category.

### Castling via the Far Side Rule versus Castling via the Sidekick Rule

Do rook and king castle as free rooks, or as restricted rooks?

Does the rook castle to the far side of the king, or as a sidekick to
the king?

Another triplet. The first rule resulted in more than 1,000 castling
permutations and converted castling from a defensive move into an
offensive move. The far side rule cut the permutations by an order of
magnitude, but often left the rook undefended by the king. These were
important invariants of 2D chess to keep.

### Single Castling versus Double Castling

If castling is ambiguous, does it occur as an either/or, or as an
optional and?

I know I'm going to take heat for this one, but it's just so cool. As a
matter of principle, what is not forbidden should be allowed. That there
is no double size linear move for the king in 2D that enables castling
on both sides simultaneously, does not mean such an option would not
have been allowed. As a practical matter, trying for a double castle
leaves the king exposed for a long time, is therefore strategically
questionable, and thus likely to be rare. But the possibility of it
happening will be a forcing function on the tactics, and that is a
welcome, very chess-like development.

### Degenerate Move Specifications

Should a move be specified by 4 choices, or should a move be specified
down to a single tile?

Consider how many choices are required to make a move. In 2D, one must
select a [piece]{.underline}, specify a [line]{.underline}, pick a
[direction]{.underline}, and then decide on a [distance]{.underline}
(how far to go); *four* steps. In 3D, one must select a
[piece]{.underline}, specify a [plane]{.underline}, pick a
[direction]{.underline} (quadrant or linear move), decide on a
[distance]{.underline} (some perimeter), and then chose a specific
[tile]{.underline} on that perimeter; *five* steps. Presumably, it would
take *six* steps in 4D chess, etc.

Without realizing we were doing it; the choice was made to require the
specification of a move to refine the options all the way down to a
*single* tile. Here is a pair of degenerate rules[]{.indexref
entry="degenerate rules:Equivalent in a lower abstraction but different in a higher abstraction."}
that have escaped our notice for the entire development. What would it
mean to move to a perimeter? In 2D, each successive 'perimeter' consists
of a *single* tile, so at that level of abstraction, the two rules are
degenerate. In 3D, in contrast, a perimeter consists of *multiple*
tiles, each perimeter larger than the last. What would it mean to move
to multiple tiles, to move to *all* the tiles on a perimeter?

What if we choose to honor the four-step invariant, instead of the
single-tile invariant?

What kind of a game do we get if we *shun* the invariant that a move is
to a *tile*, and instead *honor* the invariant that a move is to a
*perimeter*?

## Quantum Chess

Moving to a perimeter yields a *quantum* game of 3D chess; didn't see
that coming.

A quick review reveals that about 10% of the previous figures sport
multiple ghost pieces on a single perimeter. That's more than two dozen
examples of unperceived *superposition*[]{.indexref
entry="superposition:A chess piece in multiple tiles at once â super position."},
it was even listed as a quantum analog. Sigh. The unconscious mental
model was, 'pick *one* of these options' which prevented perceiving that
those images also screamed, 'pick *all* of these options.'[^69] How
typically paradigmatic -- the paradigm preventing perception outside its
barriers. Figure 9 in Chapter 1 provides a compelling example.

The commitment to discovery has paid off, but it has also saddled the
quest with tunnel vision -- no one was expecting a *pair* of rule sets;
one classical, one quantum. Yet this is typical of adventures, some
cloud-shrouded mountain beckons, and then a seemingly random event yanks
the quest in a new direction. In this case, the random event occurred
just as the quest was completed; the summit reached, the clouds parted,
and now an unexpected vista beckons -- quantum 3D chess. Another chess
variant revealed by discovery not invention, it simply emerges; a
quantum chess which *appears* simpler than its classical heritage (it
has one *less* rule), but the quantum prospect is riddled with
ambiguities. For each of these, choices will have to be made, with the
result that quantum 3D chess is neither *formally* nor *conceptually*
simpler than classical 3D chess.

Do we dare?[^70]

### Principles

The question is how to proceed. The previous criterion, to discover the
*one right rule set* that yields play which *feels like chess*, is no
longer applicable; quantum systems most definitely *do not feel* like
classical ones. Three guiding principles have been chosen; a quantum
game consists of a simultaneous set of classical games called the
[]{#classical_ensemble .anchor}*classical ensemble*[]{.indexref
entry="classical ensemble:classical ensemble"}, a quantum move should
yield a superposition (in particular it should not usually yield a
classical move), and it must not break all the games in the classical
ensemble[]{.indexref entry="classical ensemble:classical ensemble"}. In
short; []{#ensemble .anchor}ensemble[]{.indexref
entry="ensemble:Short for classical ensemble."}, superposition, &
viability -- ESV.

These principles will be applied on a case by case basis and it remains
to be seen if they can resolve all the ambiguities to come.

### An Ensemble of Classical Games

A quantum game shall be regarded as a set of simultaneous classical
games; every game in this ensemble[]{.indexref
entry="ensemble:A collection of classical games which imply a quantum game."}
has a unique history, but board states may be duplicated. In quantum 3D
chess, a piece is regarded as having moved to the *perimeter*, which
places it in a *superposition*[]{.indexref
entry="superposition:A chess piece in multiple tiles at once â super position."}
of the tiles on the perimeter. This is represented by placing
[]{#virtual_piece .anchor}*virtual pieces* on the perimeter (half size
images of the classical piece), but the set of virtual pieces is *the
piece*; they are an accounting technique. Duplicate states in the
classical ensemble[]{.indexref
entry="ensemble:A collection of classical games which imply a quantum game."}
are represented by multiple virtual pieces on the same tile, but each
virtual piece[]{.indexref
entry="virtual piece:Mini pieces used to indicate a quantum piece in a superposition."}
represents a different *history*; one unique sequence of moves. In this
game, superposition[]{.indexref
entry="superposition:A chess piece in multiple tiles at once â super position."}
is discrete, not continuous, weights are integral, not complex numbers,
and probabilities are direct, not complex conjugates (squares).

There are two major advantages to this development; the quantum rules
arise naturally from the basic rule set (no arbitrary bolting on of
quantum rules after the fact[^71]) and the classical and quantum games
are tightly coupled; a quantum game *is* an ensemble[]{.indexref
entry="ensemble:A collection of classical games which imply a quantum game."}
of classical games. Our intention is not to *invent* a quantum version
of chess, but rather to stay true to the *discovery* principle; the
quest does not change its principles only its direction -- whither
quantum? Where do quantum systems come from? And why, almost unique
amongst paradigms shifts, is the new paradigm so tightly coupled with
the old paradigm; why not a clean break? Why do we have to talk about
quantum systems in jargon that applies to classical systems?[^72]

### Swarm versus Scatter Rule

Given a piece in superposition[]{.indexref
entry="superposition:A chess piece in multiple tiles at once â super position."},
should the virtual pieces have to make the *same* move (plane, quadrant,
perimeter) or should they be allowed to make *independent* moves? Call
the first option the []{#swarm_rule .anchor}*swarm rule*[]{.indexref
entry="swarm rule:All virtual pieces make the same relative move."} (the
virtual pieces must move together) and the second the []{#scatter_rule
.anchor}*scatter rule*[]{.indexref
entry="scatter rule:Each virtual piece moves independently."} (each
virtual piece[]{.indexref
entry="virtual piece:Mini pieces used to indicate a quantum piece in a superposition."}
goes its own way). To resolve this, note that no measurements have been
made; the piece *is* the set of virtual pieces.

In classical chess, players move only one piece at a time, in a
specified direction and out a specified distance; they move to
*one-and-only-one* destination. This is an []{#absolute_move
.anchor}*absolute move*[]{.indexref
entry="absolute move:Move specified by piece and destination tile."}.
That rules out the scatter rule[]{.indexref
entry="scatter rule:Each virtual piece moves independently."} as it
requires specifying multiple destinations. This is fortuitous since the
scatter rule[]{.indexref
entry="scatter rule:Each virtual piece moves independently."} would
cause the listing of the moves of a quantum game to scale exponentially,
the swarm rule[]{.indexref
entry="swarm rule:All virtual pieces make the same relative move."} does
not. Note that a swarm move is a []{#relative_move .anchor}*relative
move*[]{.indexref
entry="relative move:Move specified by plane type, quad or linear direction, & perimeter."};
the absolute plane, quadrant and perimeter can all be different, but it
is the same *kind* of plane, in the same *direction* (quadrant, linear)
in that plane, and out the same *distance* (perimeter) in that
direction. Every virtual piece makes the *same* move.

### Pawn Advance

The pawn's advance is the simplest quantum move. Since it has restricted
direction and range (only one plane and only one quadrant in that plane,
and after its optional double advance only one perimeter), the swarm and
scatter rules are coincidentally degenerate for it.

Consider an initially classical pawn that makes five quantum moves in a
row undisturbed on an empty level, starting with its optional double
advance. What does its sequence of classical ensembles look like?

Figure 247 shows 5 snapshots which capture this progression. Virtual
pawns (half size) indicate superposition[]{.indexref
entry="superposition:A chess piece in multiple tiles at once â super position."}.
From each subfigure to the next, each virtual pawn makes the same
relative move[]{.indexref
entry="relative move:Move specified by plane type, quad or linear direction, & perimeter."};
same plane, same quadrant, same perimeter (horizontal plane, forward
quadrant, perimeter 1), splitting reality three-fold each time (the
number of tiles on a quadrant perimeter 1).

![[]{#_Ref82363300 .anchor}Figure 247: Pawn Propagating Probability
Packet](media/image248.png){alt="A picture containing text, checker Description automatically generated"
width="5.46in" height="6.36in"}

An initially classical pawn makes a quantum double advance. Shown are
the virtual pawns and the complete 3x3 advancement square for this first
move (a). The 'pawn' then makes four more quantum single advances
undisturbed by other pieces; in these latter snapshots, only the
perimeters are decorated (b) -- (e). The single full-sized ghost pawn
indicates the initial position, mini pawns (half size) represent the
superpositions. Behold; a []{#propagating_probability_packet
.anchor}*propagating probability packet*[]{.indexref
entry="propagating probability packet:Successive distributions of the virtual pieces for a repeated relative move."}.
Each virtual pawn represents one unique sequence of classical moves.
Only one reality can queen this early.

### Propagating Packet of Probability

The resulting ensemble[]{.indexref
entry="ensemble:A collection of classical games which imply a quantum game."}
of classical games behaves like a *propagating packet of probability*,
dense in the middle, sparse on the edges Each virtual pawn represents
one classical reality; to randomly pick one is to randomly pick a
classical history, one unique sequence of classical moves. The
impression of a quantum particle in motion is inescapable. While the
histories are unique, the states are not; the states in the middle of
the packet are more likely.

How did we get here?[^73]

We got here by a dogmatic commitment to discovery, letting go of the
trajectory paradigm thus accepting planar moves & advancement squares,
then recognizing that specifying a move had two specifications
(degenerate in 2D), and selecting the less obvious one.

### All versus Any Rule

There is a further ambiguity in the swarm rule[]{.indexref
entry="swarm rule:All virtual pieces make the same relative move."};
does the move have to be legal for all the virtual pieces or just one?
Call the former option the []{#all_rule .anchor}*all rule*[]{.indexref
entry="all rule:Quantum move legal only if legal for all of the virtual pieces."}
and the latter option the []{#any_rule .anchor}*any rule*[]{.indexref
entry="any rule:Quantum move legal if there is any virtual piece for which it is legal."}.

The problem with the all rule[]{.indexref
entry="all rule:Quantum move legal only if legal for all of the virtual pieces."}
is that it quickly leads to dead end situations, where pieces have no
legal moves at all. Even though every classical game in the
ensemble[]{.indexref
entry="ensemble:A collection of classical games which imply a quantum game."}
has a legal move, the quantum game is blocked, because there is no *one
move* legal in *all* the classical realities. The quantum game ends in a
stalemate, where none of the classical games of which it is composed do;
that's not consistent with the classical behavior.

### Pruning by Conflict

That leaves the any rule[]{.indexref
entry="any rule:Quantum move legal if there is any virtual piece for which it is legal."}.
Any virtual piece[]{.indexref
entry="virtual piece:Mini pieces used to indicate a quantum piece in a superposition."}
that cannot make the chosen move because it is illegal in that game is
removed from the board -- which also eliminates its history and the
associated classical game from the ensemble[]{.indexref
entry="ensemble:A collection of classical games which imply a quantum game."}.
Classical games should be []{#self_consistent
.anchor}*self-consistent*[]{.indexref
entry="self-consistent:Every game in the ensemble must be legal, consistent with the rules."}.
Quantum moves which are consistent in some classical games, but not in
others, are legal, but they prune the classical ensemble[]{.indexref
entry="classical ensemble:classical ensemble"}. For those realities, the
move *conflicts* with the state of the board; call this
[]{#pruning_by_conflict .anchor}*pruning by conflict*[]{.indexref
entry="pruning by conflict:Ensemble pruned because move was blocked for that virtual piece."}.
This has the side effect of reducing the degree of
superposition[[]{.indexref
entry="decoherence:Quantum systems tend to lose coherence because of the environment."}]{.indexref
entry="superposition:A chess piece in multiple tiles at once â super position."}.
This constraint is very powerful. A move that is illegal in *most* of
the classical games is []{#barely_legal .anchor}*barely
legal*[]{.indexref
entry="barely legal:A quantum move that prunes most of the realities out of the ensemble."}.

### Diffraction

To see how the any/all rules work out when not all virtual pieces can
make the chosen move, repeat the situation in Figure 247 but with an
obstacle placed in front of the pawn[]{.indexref
entry="propagating probability packet:Successive distributions of the virtual pieces for a repeated relative move."}.

Figure 248 shows a Black opposing pawn on K4,4. Let the White pawn
advance without hindrance; Black makes no interfering moves; he neither
advances nor captures. Also, restrict the White pawn from capturing;
advance moves only. By move two, the forward most virtual pawn is
blocked by the Black classical pawn; the others not yet. Figure 248 (a)
shows that under the *all* rule[]{.indexref
entry="all rule:Quantum move legal only if legal for all of the virtual pieces."}
the pawn would not be able to advance anymore; the leading virtual pawn
has no legal moves at all. Under the *any* rule[]{.indexref
entry="any rule:Quantum move legal if there is any virtual piece for which it is legal."}
the pawn may continue to advance (b-f).

In contrast to the previous figure, the advancement square for the first
move, the double advance, is not shown; just the perimeter. This
provides an alternative, but more consistent view of the propagation
packet.

![[]{#_Ref82418460 .anchor}Figure 248: Pawn Diffraction Propagating
Packet of
Probability](media/image249.png){alt="A close-up of a computer screen Description automatically generated with low confidence"
width="5.45in" height="7.65in"}

Six snapshots of a quantum pawn diffracting around a fixed obstacle
(Black pawn); advance only, no captures. Pawn is slowed by two moves,
(f) has still not promoted. Note the diffraction shadow[]{.indexref
entry="diffraction shadow:The reduction of probability after diffracting around an obstacle."};
the probability density is lower behind the Black pawn. Only the
perimeters have been decorated.

Under classical 3D rules, there are many paths by which pawns on the
same level can sneak around each other. Thus, the all rule[]{.indexref
entry="all rule:Quantum move legal only if legal for all of the virtual pieces."}
fails to be consistent with the classical game. By the discovery
principle the choice must be the any rule[]{.indexref
entry="any rule:Quantum move legal if there is any virtual piece for which it is legal."}.
Thus, in the quantum game, the White pawn easily diffracts around the
Blank pawn.

While there is no interference pattern, there is a
[]{#diffraction_shadow .anchor}*diffraction shadow*[]{.indexref
entry="diffraction shadow:The reduction of probability after diffracting around an obstacle."}
on the far side of the Black pawn, where the probability density is
lower. Having to go around the obstacle pawn slows the White pawn's
march to promotion by two moves. Except for the shackled shortcut, it
requires such pawns at least 7 moves to promote, versus the best case of
5 moves for unblocked pawns.

### Numerical Representation of Superposition

As the degree of superposition[]{.indexref
entry="superposition:A chess piece in multiple tiles at once â super position."}
increases, the use of mini pawns to indicate superposition[]{.indexref
entry="superposition:A chess piece in multiple tiles at once â super position."}
becomes awkward. An alternative is to use a numerical representation of
the pawn propagating probability packets.

Figure 249 shows the two previous superposition examples numerically,
snapshot by snapshot, and side-by-side. The left-hand column is for
Figure 247 (a)-(e), where the pawn advances without an obstacle, while
the right-hand column is for Figure 248 (f)-(k), where the pawn faced a
stationary obstacle (the Black pawn).

### Quantum Move Notation

Standard chess notation implies an *absolute move*[]{.indexref
entry="absolute move:Move specified by piece and destination tile."},
one that assumes a unique source tile (current location) and specifies
one, and only one, destination tile. The swarm rule needs a way to
indicate a *relative move*, something that can be applied to each
virtual piece. A quantum move shall be indicated by specifying an
[]{#anchor .anchor}*anchor piece*[]{.indexref
entry="anchor:Location of a virtual piece selected as the source tile for a relative move."}
and a []{#proxy_tile .anchor}*proxy tile*[]{.indexref
entry="proxy tile:Destination tile assuming anchor as source, in standard chess notation."}.
One virtual piece[]{.indexref
entry="virtual piece:Mini pieces used to indicate a quantum piece in a superposition."}
is marked as the anchor (its location is placed inside parenthesis right
after the piece designation), and a destination tile on the perimeter is
selected as a proxy tile (its location is placed inside square brackets
right after the dash).

The selection of the anchor[]{.indexref
entry="anchor:Location of a virtual piece selected as the source tile for a relative move."}
piece is a matter of style; it at least is always on the board.
Technically, it doesn't matter which non-end tile on the perimeter is
indicated as the proxy tile. However, there is often one virtual
piece[]{.indexref
entry="virtual piece:Mini pieces used to indicate a quantum piece in a superposition."}
that seems to dominate the group of virtual pieces, and all things being
equal, it is generally the preferred choice for the anchor[]{.indexref
entry="anchor:Location of a virtual piece selected as the source tile for a relative move."}.
The apex tile is a natural choice for quadrant moves, one easy to
visualize, but it is often off the board. For instance, the propagating
pawn probability packet of Figure 247 could be represented like this;

[WHITE]{.underline} [BLACK]{.underline}

1\. P(K2,2) -- \[K4,4\] \-\--

2\. P(K4,4) -- \[K5,5\] \-\--

3\. P(K5,5) -- \[K6,6\] \-\--

4\. P(K6,6) -- \[K7,7\] \-\--

5\. P(K7,7) -- \[K8,8\]q \-\--

![[]{#_Ref83823670 .anchor}Figure 249: Numerical Capture of the Pawn's
Propagating Probability
Packet](media/image250.png){alt="Background pattern Description automatically generated"
width="6.444444444444445in" height="7.625in"}

The probability packets for the previous pair of figures are shown
numerically. Column one shows the unopposed case (a)-(e), column two the
obstacle case (f)-(k). The pawn's degree of super-position increases
with each snapshot; in the first case growing by a factor of 3 each
time; 5 (a), 15 (b), 45 (c), 135 (d), and 405 (e), but somewhat more
haphazardly in the second case; 5 (f), 12 (g), 24 (h), 48 (i), 132 (j)
and 300 (k). The obstacle slows the leading edge, but not the trailing
one.

The relative move between the anchor and the proxy is then applied to
every other virtual piece. For the diffraction example, an anchor tile
on either side of the obstacle pawn could be chosen.

### Pruning by Differentiation

In the pawn propagating packet example, a further subtlety arises; at
the end of move five, one virtual piece[]{.indexref
entry="virtual piece:Mini pieces used to indicate a quantum piece in a superposition."}
has the right to promote (the virtual queen on tile 8,8), and 94 have
the right to become unshackled (half on either back plane). How does one
specify a 'relative' move under these conditions? Different rules apply
to these three different sets of virtual pieces; they have
[]{#differentiated .anchor}*differentiated*[]{.indexref
entry="differentiated:Virtual pieces subject to different move rules."}
because of their differing locations on the board.

The any rule[]{.indexref
entry="any rule:Quantum move legal if there is any virtual piece for which it is legal."}
solves this problem also. If the queened piece is selected as the
anchor[]{.indexref
entry="anchor:Location of a virtual piece selected as the source tile for a relative move."},
then none of the other pawns have legal moves (they can't move like
queens), and all the classical games they represent are pruned from the
classical ensemble[]{.indexref
entry="ensemble:A collection of classical games which imply a quantum game."}.
If an unshackled pawn is selected as an anchor[]{.indexref
entry="anchor:Location of a virtual piece selected as the source tile for a relative move."},
then its move is illegal for the queened pawn, all the still shackled
pawns, and all the unshackled pawns in the other back plane. Again, the
classical ensemble[]{.indexref
entry="ensemble:A collection of classical games which imply a quantum game."}
gets pruned. If a still shackled pawn is selected as the
anchor[]{.indexref
entry="anchor:Location of a virtual piece selected as the source tile for a relative move."},
then the queen moves off the board as do many of the unshackled pawns,
more illegal moves, which are therefore also pruned out of existence.
Call this []{#pruning_by_differentiation .anchor}*pruning by
differentiation*[]{.indexref
entry="pruning by differentiation:Ensemble pruned because move not allowed for other virtual pieces."}.
Capture also leads to differentiation; pieces in the tray can't move.

Its workable. Every virtual piece[]{.indexref
entry="virtual piece:Mini pieces used to indicate a quantum piece in a superposition."}
still on the board represents a sequence of classical moves that fully
comply with the classical rules. The quantum game continues to consist
of an ensemble[]{.indexref
entry="ensemble:A collection of classical games which imply a quantum game."}
of self-consistent[]{.indexref
entry="self-consistent:Every game in the ensemble must be legal, consistent with the rules."}
classical games; that's the sacrosanct discovery principle for quantum
3D chess.

### End Tiles and Plane Independence

The idea of moving to the perimeter is pretty clear for pawns, but it is
not so clear for the other pieces. The problem is the end tiles; they
have different rules for blocking. Should they be considered part of the
perimeter? Other pieces *on them* will block advance to that perimeter.
Moves *to them* will only be legal if the adjacent quadrant is also
clear, or if an orthogonal plane is clear.

The chess invariant of plane independence suggests that the orthogonal
planes should be ignored; thus, placing a virtual piece on an end tile
depends only on the adjacent quadrant.

### Focused Superposition

This is where the principle of discovery has led. However, quantum 3D
chess is not really playable, at least not by humans; it's too
complicated. What it might be suitable for however, is as an abstract
vehicle to explore the connection between classical and quantum
realities. For that purpose, what is better is to invent[^74] some kind
of variable superposition.

Therefore, allow players to restrict the degree of superposition to less
than the perimeter. The superposition shall be balanced around the proxy
tile; call this []{#focused_superposition .anchor}*focused
superposition*[]{.indexref
entry="focused superposition:Player specifies spread of superposition around proxy, an odd integer."}
There is an easy notation for this, subscripts after the square brackets
around the proxy tile. For instance, a rook pure quadrant[]{.indexref
entry="pure quadrant:Quadrant move which does not include the end tiles."}
move to perimeter 3 would specify the proxy tile this way;

R(KR4,4) -- \[KR7,7\]~5~

while the same move, but as a full quadrant[]{.indexref
entry="full quadrant:Quadrant move which does include the end tiles."}
move, would be specified this way;

R(KR4,4) -- \[KR7,7\]~7~

The latter example includes the end tiles. If the adjacent quadrant in
the same plane is clear, a virtual piece is placed there, otherwise not.

Linear moves just need two subscripts (three for the duke);

R(K4,4) -- \[K4,7\]~5,5~

This is a relative move in two planes, to perimeter 3 in both planes.
Each advancement rectangle has a perimeter with 13 tiles on it, but only
5 will have virtual pieces on them. It is a focused quantum move with
less superposition than a pure linear move. In this example, not only
are the two pairs of end tiles not included, neither are the skinny
edges of the advancement rectangles, nor the apex tiles. Wrapping past
either end tile is prohibited. For symmetry reasons, the degree of
superposition must be an odd integer, centered on the proxy tile. This
is true even if half of the superposition gets truncated by the closer
end tile; the subscripts indicate *intent*, not necessarily the *actual*
number of virtual pieces.

To have different levels of superposition between two planes, which
plane each subscript applies to has to be specified. For rook and
bishop, this is easy; (H, L, R) and (U, D, L, R). For the duke it's a
little more challenging; in part because the plane names don't reduce
nicely to a single character, in part because duplex moves must also be
accounted for.

For the queen and stack, the overlap tiles add another wrinkle. Index
order shall be rook, bishop, duke, with up to 4 indexes required.

There is one more challenge with focused superpositions; how to handle
proxy tiles off the board -- that problem will be left as an exercise
for the Intrepid Reader.

Focused superposition offers a big advantage at this stage of
development, we still have to determine an objective measurement
mechanism; what kind of an entanglement between multiple pieces is
required to claim, objectively, that it is time for a different kind of
move, a collapse move, where one player must choose which of several
classical games is the one kept while the others are forcibly pruned
from the classical ensemble[]{.indexref
entry="ensemble:A collection of classical games which imply a quantum game."}.
Being able to sharply curtail the degree of superposition will aid in
that quest.

This is why quantum tic-tac-toe[^75] purposefully limited superposition
to exactly two squares; it prevented the quantum version from
degenerating to a classical game on one hand and exploding to hyper
superposition that made the game unplayable on the other.

But focused superposition[]{.indexref
entry="focused superposition:Player specifies spread of superposition around proxy, an odd integer."}
comes with a major downside; it violates the discovery principle, for it
fails to honor the four-choice invariant, instead requiring five
choices. This objection can be overcome with a null rule. Consider that
a move can consistently require the specification of *five* choices;
[piece]{.underline}, [manifold]{.underline} (line in 2D, plane in 3D),
[direction]{.underline} (straight line in 2D, either quadrant or linear
in 3D), [distance]{.underline} (anchor and proxy), and
[spread]{.underline} (how many tiles around the proxy are in
superposition).

In classical chess, both 2D & 3D, the anchor is automatically taken as
the current location of the piece to be moved. The fifth choice is the
spread, but it's limited to the number of tiles on the perimeter; it's
just that in 2D classical chess, the upper limit on the spread is
independent of the perimeter (distance) and is capped at one. That's the
null rule. So...one could argue that even in 2D there are actually
(ahem) five choices. This invariant will even be preserved (sigh) in
quantum 4D chess.

Admittedly, this is a weak argument, but 3D chess is barely playable
even with good software support, quantum 3D chess is pretty much beyond
human computation. The discovery quest has changed from a playable game
to a useful metaphor. On that criteria, focused
superposition[]{.indexref
entry="focused superposition:Player specifies spread of superposition around proxy, an odd integer."}
is a good choice, but from a playability perspective should be
considered a balance rule.

Figure 250 shows six examples of a rook making different quantum moves
in the horizontal plane into quadrant 1. The first example is a pure
quadrant[]{.indexref
entry="pure quadrant:Quadrant move which does not include the end tiles."}
move, note the lack of virtual rooks on the end tiles (a). The second is
a full quadrant[]{.indexref
entry="full quadrant:Quadrant move which does include the end tiles."}
move, note the existence of virtual rooks on the end tiles (b). The
third is also a full quadrant[]{.indexref
entry="full quadrant:Quadrant move which does include the end tiles."}
move, but the knight blocks the linear move to one of the end tiles (c).
Even if this move is unblocked in the vertical plane, plane independence
requires that a quantum move intended for one plane has no realities in
the classical ensemble[]{.indexref
entry="ensemble:A collection of classical games which imply a quantum game."}
in which movement is in another plane.

The fourth example is a focused quadrant move with a spread of 3 (d). In
these first four examples the proxy tile was the apex tile; the anchor
defaulted to the location of the classical rook. Under such cases
specifying the tile of the anchor piece is optional. The degree of
focusing is specified by the spread term, the subscript. The fifth
example is a focused superposition[]{.indexref
entry="focused superposition:Player specifies spread of superposition around proxy, an odd integer."}
to a body tile, also with a spread of 3 (e). The sixth, and final
example, shows a focused superposition[]{.indexref
entry="focused superposition:Player specifies spread of superposition around proxy, an odd integer."}
using a proxy tile off the board (7,9). Note that all the virtual rooks
off the board are dimmed (f).

For the rook, the resulting set of virtual rooks can usually be achieved
with a proxy tile on the board, but for the bishop and duke, this is
often not possible. No attempt in this chapter has been made to specify
a notation for these situations.

One last point; for the very intrepid, who insist on trying to play a
quantum game, the players can simply agree to maximum superposition. Now
the proxy tile subscript, call it *spread*, is no longer a move
*specification*, rather it serves a *diagnostic* purpose; it clearly
communicates the degree of superposition, lowering, however slightly,
the computational load of trying to *play* quantum 3D chess.

Thus, the rubric for relative moves required by quantum moves, follows
this template;

piece(anchor) -- \[proxy\]~spread,...~

![[]{#_Ref82619063 .anchor}Figure 250: Rook Quantum Quadrant Moves with
Various
Spreads](media/image251.png){alt="A picture containing text, checker Description automatically generated"

Six examples of a rook making quantum moves in the horizontal plane into
quadrant 1. Pure quadrant to perimeter 3, R(KR3,3) -- \[KR6,6\]~5~ (a).
Full quadrant to perimeter 3, R(KR3,3) -- \[KR6,6\]~7~ (b). Semi blocked
(by knight) full quadrant[]{.indexref

to off board body tile of perimeter 5, R(KR3,4) -- \[KR7,9\]~7~ (f).
Ghost virtual pieces are not valid moves.

Figure 251 shows two examples of a rook making a quantum linear move
with *symmetric* spreads. Note that the spread subscripts on the proxy
tile are just numbers and of equal value. The White rook's move would be
regarded as a pure linear move; the Black rook's move a tightly focused
one.

![[]{#_Ref82682186 .anchor}Figure 251: Rook Quantum Linear Moves with
Equal
Spreads](media/image252.png){alt="A picture containing shape Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="6.402777777777778in"}

The White rook makes a quantum linear move with equal spread to
perimeter 2 in the horizontal and left vertical planes, R(KB3,1) --
\[KB3,3\]~7,7~, (a). This would be regarded as a pure linear move; note
the lack of virtual rooks on the end tiles. The Black rook makes a
quantum linear move with equal spread to perimeter 3 in the vertical
planes, R(QR4,4) -- \[Q4,4\]~5,5~, (b). This is a focused
superposition[]{.indexref
entry="focused superposition:Player specifies spread of superposition around proxy, an odd integer."};
note that the virtual rooks don't even make it to the apex tiles.

Figure 252 shows two examples of a rook making a *differentially*
focused quantum linear move, thus the spreads are unequal. Note that the
spread subscripts on the proxy tile are of unequal values and require
plane designators. The bishop and duke follow a similar line of
development.

![[]{#_Ref82682193 .anchor}Figure 252: Rook Quantum Linear Moves with
Differential
Spreads](media/image253.png){alt="A picture containing shape Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="6.402777777777778in"}

The White rook makes a quantum linear move with unequal spreads to
perimeter 2 in the horizontal and left vertical planes, R(KB3,1) --
\[KB3,3\]~H1,L9~, (a). This would be regarded as a full linear move only
in the vertical plane; note the lack of virtual rooks in the horizontal
plane. The Black rook makes a quantum linear move with unequal spreads
to perimeter 3 in the vertical planes, R(QR4,4) -- \[Q4,4\]~L7,R3~, (b).
These are both differential focused superpositions.

### The Knight

The knight doesn't advance, it jumps; no perimeter to advance to. One
option is to leave it classical; the alternative takes its inspiration
from the knight's status as the ani-queen; let it attempt a base piece
type of move -- but it gets deflected to a non-queen tile.

Figure 253 shows the three possibilities; rook, bishop, duke.

![[]{#_Ref82592711 .anchor}Figure 253: The Knight's Three Quantum
Moves](media/image254.png){alt="A picture containing checker Description automatically generated"
width="6.44in" height="5.34in"}

The knight's 3 superposition moves. The lowest 3 levels are not shown.
Treating the knight as the anti-queen allows for deflecting its attempt
to move as one of the base pieces. Knight has three quantum moves; (a)
deflected rook (headed up, top face, 8 virtual knights, N(KB6,3) --
\[KR6,3\]~R~), (b) deflected bishop (headed down-right, bottom-right
edge, 2 virtual knights, N(KB6,3) -- \[Q6,1\]~B~), and (c) deflected
duke (head down-left, bottom corner, 3 virtual knights, N(KB6,3) --
\[Q8,5\]~D~). Original position indicated with ghost knight & source
tile; each base piece straight-line move indicated via decorated tiles
of the base piece colors.

Let the knight attempt a rook move; it gets deflected on its way to a
face. Let it attempt a bishop move; it gets deflected on its way to an
edge. Let it attempt a duke move; it gets deflected on its way to a
corner. Call this the []{#deflection_rule .anchor}*deflection
rule*[]{.indexref
entry="deflection rule:Knight achieves superposition by deflecting a rook/bishop/duke move."}.

If the knight tries a rook like move (vertical) it gets deflected into
an 8-way superposition (a). If it tries a bishop move (down right) it
gets deflected into a 2-way superposition (b). If it tries a duke move
(down left) it gets deflected into a 3-way superposition (c).

There is no obvious way to limit the spread.

It's hard to argue that this is a rule of discovery; feels more like a
rule of invention. If applied to 2D, it would always place the knight in
a 2-way superposition. Later developments will strengthen this choice a
bit, but it is admittedly the least discovery-like rule proposed for
quantum 3D chess. It's this, or classical, or someone comes up with a
better idea.[^76]

### The Stack

When a quantum stack decays, the emitted piece is easily put into a
superposition, by the processes already discussed. The problem is when
it moves as a stack. Both overlap tiles (Q and Feynman) have one sub
piece moving to an apex tile, but there is only one apex tile per
perimeter so moving to a perimeter fails to place the stack, as a stack,
into a superposition.

A superposition could be forced by specifying two or more overlap tiles,
but this is not consistent with the classical invariant of moving to a
single destination. It is the equivalent of adding superposition to 2D
chess by letting a piece move different distances or in different
directions along the same line, or even along different lines; invention
not discovery.

The resolution comes from an unexpected source; the quantum fission
move. In fission, each sub piece is allowed to make a superposition
move. In all of the realities in the classical ensemble[]{.indexref
entry="ensemble:A collection of classical games which imply a quantum game."},
every virtual bishop, and every virtual duke, will be on different
tiles, except one; the overlap tile. On that tile only, there will be a
virtual bishop *and* a virtual duke -- a virtual stack.

In other words, the classical stack move is just a []{#failed_fission
.anchor}*failed fission*[]{.indexref
entry="failed fission:A quantum stack fission tile that contains both virtual bishop & duke."}.
The Intrepid Reader was promised, many chapters ago, that the choice of
anchoring the fission move with a common overlap tile was going to
constitute a Big Reveal. This is it. The discovery of the correct
fission rule for 3D classical chess came not from 2D chess, nor from
some overlooked degenerate invariant, nor even from the excursion to 4D
chess. Rather it comes from the excursion to a higher abstraction, one
in a completely unanticipated direction, the quantum direction, to
inform the correct specification of the lower abstraction.

Lateral thinking is one of the ways to break through paradigms. Here you
are, trying to solve some problem X; and its proving resistant. Along
comes your genius friend, and they say, "try to solve problem Y." You
look at them cross-eyed; it's hard enough to find the resources to solve
one problem, let alone two. Yet, if Y is chosen carefully, if it has
some deep relation with X, then, just maybe, solving Y will in fact also
solve X.

That's the case here. An unrestricted fission move gave the stack too
much power, but limiting it to decay moves and the rare stack move
seemed arbitrary, even petty. The question was how to limit the fission
move in a natural way. Enter quantum 3D chess. The quantum version has
informed the classical version. This pushes both variations closer to a
discovery rule rather than some arbitrary rule of invention. What a
fascinating teleology; two competing paradigms each informing on the
correctness of the other.[^77]

Indeed, the classical stack move can be explicitly expressed as a
quantum fission move with spread 1 on both sub pieces. One point for the
focused superposition[]{.indexref
entry="focused superposition:Player specifies spread of superposition around proxy, an odd integer."}
rule.

The sub pieces went quantum, but should the stack be regarded as a
virtual piece? There is only one of them. As is the case for quantum
pawn promoting, pruning by differentiation resolves the problem. If on a
later move, the stack is chosen as the anchor, it has three legal moves;
bishop decay, duke decay, or fission.

The decay moves are not a problem; if the stack decays by bishop
emission the virtual bishops simply make the same relative move, ditto
for stack decay by duke emission. However, if the stack fissions, having
the other virtual pieces (bishops & dukes) make the same relative move
would have *two* pieces move at once (a bishop and a duke) in all those
classical realities and that is inconsistent with the classical rules.
So, if the stack fissions, all the other realities where the bishop and
duke are separate pieces get pruned by differentiation.

Similarly, selecting any single virtual bishop or duke as the anchor
simply implies that that particular sub piece leaves the stack as a
decay move. As long as the classical histories are
self-consistent[]{.indexref
entry="self-consistent:Every game in the ensemble must be legal, consistent with the rules."},
the moves should be allowed.

A natural question is whether a stack can end up in a superposition, one
where there is more than one virtual stack. Turns out to be easy. Let a
duke be in superposition, let a bishop also be in superposition. Now
move the bishop. Select a virtual bishop as an anchor and select a proxy
tile; this specifies a relative move. Apply to all the virtual bishops.
If the initial distribution of virtual dukes and bishops, and the
subsequent selection of anchor, proxy, and spread are done with a
modicum of skill, then several of the virtual bishops will end up on
tiles which contain virtual dukes. Two or more such tiles yield a stack
in superposition.

In each of the classical realities where this happens, a recombination
move (or a cross combination move) has occurred, and there will now be
*multiple virtual stacks* on the board. For the stack to go into a
superposition, it must first die. How intriguing.

A maximally focused quantum fission \[Q5,5\]~1,1,1~ is just the
classical stack move.

Figure 254 shows an example of quantum fission anchored by a q-tile.

![[]{#_Ref82592723 .anchor}Figure 254: Quantum Fission to a
Q-tile](media/image255.png){alt="A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated with medium confidence"
width="6.5in" height="6.402777777777778in"}

In stack fission, both sub pieces must move in the same 'direction,'
they must share an overlap tile. Perimeter 2 apex for the duke (major
plane), and perimeter 4 linear for the bishop (outward planes) overlap
on Q5,5. Every tile on the perimeters get a virtual piece. The stack
started on Q1,1, with overlap q-tile on Q5,5, which is the only tile
with both a virtual duke and a virtual bishop. A stack move is the one
classical reality where a quantum fission move failed. There are 5
classical realities for the duke and 21 for the bishop; 105 realities in
the classical ensemble[]{.indexref
entry="ensemble:A collection of classical games which imply a quantum game."}.
In one of these, the stack failed to fission, S(Q1,1) --
\[Q5,5\]~17,17,5~.

### Queen & King, and the Pawn Attack

The quantum moves for the queen & king, and for pawn attacks are almost
straight forward; the minor subtleties are not too difficult to work
through but are tedious and lengthy. They will be left to the skills of
the reader.

### Virtual Piece Interactions

With the quantum rules for how individual pieces move under our belt,
more or less, it's time to ask how virtual pieces interact with each
other. What happens when multiple pieces are in superposition? What
happens when they become entangled?

Pieces interact in two main ways; capture and blocking. Both may result
in separable states, but both may also result in entangled states.

### Jargon for Virtual Pieces

The piece in motion will be called the []{#active_piece .anchor}*active
piece*[]{.indexref entry="active piece:The quantum piece being moved."},
each piece it is interacting with will be referred to as a
[]{#fixed_piece .anchor}*fixed piece*[]{.indexref
entry="fixed piece:Any piece which an active piece engages."}. Each is
assumed to be in a weighted superposition, but with the recognition that
a classical piece has a superposition value of 1 for the one-and-only
tile it is on. All superposition weights are integral. While each
virtual piece represents a unique history for that piece, the tile it is
on represents its current classical state as a result of that history.
Duplicate classical states are indicated on the quantum board by having
multiple virtual pieces on the same tile. For very high weights, a
number will supplant the duplicates.

### Tagged Virtual Pieces

Once more than one piece is in superposition, determining which set of
virtual pieces belongs to which 'real' piece becomes problematical. For
the bishop and duke, this is not a big problem for they are both
confined to their own 'colors.' For the knight, parity knights can be
used; the head of the king knight turns left, the head of the queen
knight turns right. For the rooks, a simple 'K' or 'Q' tag suffices. For
the pawns, they don't need a tag unless they have a capture in their
history; then a two-digit tag identifying their starting level should
suffice. For large superpositions, the tags will be difficult to see
however, and a coloring scheme might be better. It might also make sense
to just have a mini piece with a number indicating the superposition
weight, and the tag could just be integrated into that character string,
ala "KR-2455". These technical difficulties will be ignored in order to
focus on the real quest of this chapter -- does quantum 3D chess support
an objective measurement mechanism?

### Representing State

In both physics and games, there is the concept of *state*, that a
system is in some particular state, and that there is an effective means
of indicating this state; vector space mathematics for physics and
pieces on a board for a game. The state encodes everything that can be
known about the game. In theory, the legality of a move depends solely
on the rules and the state of the board. However, chess violates this
fundamental paradigm in two ways; en passant and castling.

In en passant, pawn capture to the skipped position of the opposing pawn
may be achieved only on the very next move. This rule depends not only
on the current state, but also upon the immediately preceding one.
Castling is even worse, for the king and rooks may have not only moved
and retreated but done so many moves ago. The legality of these two
moves depends upon more than just the current state. However, the amount
of information required to deal with this for each player is, literally,
11 bits; 8 for the pawns and 3 for king & two rooks. These bits can be
formally rolled into the specification of state in order to maintain the
state paradigm.

Up to this point it has been implied that the state of a quantum game
can be indicated by using mini pieces to represent virtual pieces. A
rook in a 9-way superposition will have 9 mini rooks on the board, a
pawn in a 135-way superposition will have 135 mini pawns on the board,
etc. This is universally true for separable states, but as we are about
to see, the case for entangled pieces is more complex, and more subtle
than anticipated.

### Separability versus Entanglement

Two quantum pieces are in a []{#separable_state .anchor}*separable
state*[]{.indexref
entry="separable state:System state is the product of the individual states."}
when the product of their superpositions correctly characterizes the
classical ensemble[]{.indexref
entry="classical ensemble:classical ensemble"}. Non-separable pieces are
entangled. This can be represented in a non-standard Dirac notation
where each tile on the board represents a state, like this \|K1,1\>, and
the normalization constant is not under the square root radical (unlike
in quantum mechanics). For instance, two pieces, each in two-way
superpositions, but which are not entangled, are separable.
Individually, their states would be represented by a pair of equations.

$\Psi_{N} = \frac{1}{2}\left\{ {|\left. \ K4,3 \right\rangle}_{N}\ \bigoplus\ {|\left. \ K6,3 \right\rangle}_{N} \right\}$
(2)

$\Psi_{R} = \frac{1}{2}\left\{ {|\left. \ K1,1 \right\rangle}_{R}\ \bigoplus\ {|\left. \ K1,2 \right\rangle}_{R} \right\}$
(3)

Here is the product state, where either piece may be in either tile,
independently of the other.

$\Psi_{NR} = \frac{1}{4}\left\{ \begin{array}{r}
{|\left. \ K4,3 \right\rangle}_{N}{|\left. \ K1,1 \right\rangle}_{R}\ \bigoplus\ {|\left. \ K6,3 \right\rangle}_{N}{|\left. \ K1,1 \right\rangle}_{R}\bigoplus \\
{|\left. \ K4,3 \right\rangle}_{N}{|\left. \ K1,2 \right\rangle}_{R}\ \bigoplus\ {|\left. \ K6,3 \right\rangle}_{N}{|\left. \ K1,2 \right\rangle}_{R}\ \ \ \ 
\end{array} \right\}$ (4)

Thus, it should be clear that there are 4 realities in the classical
ensemble[]{.indexref entry="classical ensemble:classical ensemble"}.

Figure 255 shows the corresponding state of the quantum board.

The White knight and rook are both in 2-way superpositions, but since
they share no tiles, their states are separable. There are therefore, 4
possible classical realities; 2x2.

If they share one state, both are still in a simple 2-way
superpositions.

$\Psi_{N} = \frac{1}{2}\left\{ {|\left. \ K4,3 \right\rangle}_{N}\ \bigoplus\ {|\left. \ K6,3 \right\rangle}_{N} \right\}$
(5)

$\Psi_{R} = \frac{1}{2}\left\{ {|\left. \ K4,3 \right\rangle}_{R}\ \bigoplus\ {|\left. \ K1,2 \right\rangle}_{R} \right\}$
(6)

but the product state now looks like this, because they can't both be in
the same tile.

$\Psi_{NR} = \frac{1}{3}\left\{ \begin{array}{r}
{|\left. \ K4,3 \right\rangle}_{N}{|\left. \ K4,3 \right\rangle}_{R}\ \bigoplus\ {|\left. \ K6,3 \right\rangle}_{N}{|\left. \ K4,3 \right\rangle}_{R}\bigoplus \\
{|\left. \ K4,3 \right\rangle}_{N}{|\left. \ K1,2 \right\rangle}_{R}\ \bigoplus\ {|\left. \ K6,3 \right\rangle}_{N}{|\left. \ K1,2 \right\rangle}_{R}\ \ \ \ 
\end{array} \right\}$ (7)

Thus, it should be clear that there are now only 3 realities in the
classical ensemble[]{.indexref
entry="classical ensemble:classical ensemble"}.

Figure 256 shows the corresponding state of the board.

The White knight and rook are still each in 2-way superpositions, but
since they now share a tile, the combined state is no longer separable;
they are entangled. In this example, a semi-entanglement.

This is referred to as a []{#semi_entangled_state
.anchor}*semi-entangled state*[]{.indexref
entry="semi-entangled state:A pair of pieces in a 2-way entanglement that share only one tile."}.

If they share two states, both are still in simple 2-way superpositions.

$\Psi_{N} = \frac{1}{2}\left\{ {|\left. \ K4,3 \right\rangle}_{N}\ \bigoplus\ {|\left. \ K1,2 \right\rangle}_{N} \right\}$
(8)

$\Psi_{R} = \frac{1}{2}\left\{ {|\left. \ K4,3 \right\rangle}_{R}\ \bigoplus\ {|\left. \ K1,2 \right\rangle}_{R} \right\}$
(9)

but the product state now looks like this, because they can't both be in
the same tile.

$\Psi_{NR} = \frac{1}{2}\left\{ \begin{array}{r}
{|\left. \ K4,3 \right\rangle}_{N}{|\left. \ K4,3 \right\rangle}_{R}\ \bigoplus\ {|\left. \ K1,2 \right\rangle}_{N}{|\left. \ K4,3 \right\rangle}_{R}\bigoplus \\

\end{array} \right\}$ (10)

Thus, it should be clear that there are now only 2 realities in the
classical ensemble[]{.indexref
entry="classical ensemble:classical ensemble"}.

Figure 257 shows the corresponding state of the quantum board.

The White knight and rook are still each in 2-way superpositions, but
since they now share two tiles, the combined state is no longer
separable; they are entangled. In this example, an EPR entanglement.

This is referred to as an []{#EPR_entanglement_state .anchor}*EPR
entanglement state*[]{.indexref
entry="EPR entanglement state:A pair of pieces fully entangled; if one is here, the other is there."}.
It is a full entanglement state; the name comes from a paper by
Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen who first explored quantum states of this
nature.[^78]

### Network Graphs

Games can be represented abstractly by network graphs. A network graph
consists of nodes and directed branches that connect them. For games,
each node represents one specific position on the board, and the
directed branches represent all the legal moves from that position
(node) to another position (another node). There is a lot of complexity
here. For pedagogical purposes, the networks graphs will be represented
as pure trees, their simpler cousins.

A classical game consists of precisely one sequence of branches down the
game tree. At any point in the game, one and only one node is the
current state of the system. In contrast, a quantum game consists of
many sequences of branches, each one corresponds to one legal history,
and there are many current nodes. The set of current nodes represents
the quantum state of the board. In both regimes the network graph
encapsulates what is allowed.

Figure 258 shows a stylistic game tree with one path indicated -- a
classical game.

![[]{#_Ref83814460 .anchor}Figure 258: A Classical Game is One Path
Through the Game Tree](media/image259.png){width="6.402777777777778in"
height="1.3472222222222223in"}

A single path through a game tree represents one history, one specific
game; a classical game.

Figure 259 shows the same stylistic game tree, but with multiple paths
indicated -- a quantum game.

![[]{#_Ref83814468 .anchor}Figure 259: A Quantum Game is Multiple Paths
Through the Game
Tree](media/image260.png){alt="A picture containing night sky Description automatically generated"
width="6.402777777777778in" height="1.3472222222222223in"}

Multiple paths through a game tree represent superposition, multiple
classical games in play at once; a quantum game.

Observe that paths can terminate. The latest row of nodes is the
present; when more than one node is active, there are multiple realities
in the classical ensemble[]{.indexref
entry="classical ensemble:classical ensemble"}. Pruning truncates some
of the paths; those realities don't persist into the future. So far,
we've seen pruning by conflict and by differentiation. If quantum 3D
chess supports an objective measurement mechanism, we can expect pruning
by measurement.

For game trees, a complete and total measurement truncates to a single
path, leaving just one classical reality. By tracing backwards up the
path, one uncovers the history of that reality, but this path tracing
does not reveal what, if any, truncated pasts were in existence.
Truncated pasts represent, ahem, pasts that have no longer occurred, but
their transitory 'existence' likely had an effect on the eventual
reality that persisted. Hmmm, "pasts that no longer exist affected the
present." Natural languages don't even support the tenses needed to talk
about this stuff.

Network graphs are an important data structure in software engineering,
and there is a substantial body of literature addressing the use of
network graphs; how to represent them, how to traverse them, how to
assess various properties, etc. Almost universally, such discussions
focus on one path, finding it, optimizing it, proving it exists, etc.
The system is assumed to be classical, always in only one node, not in
many. There is virtually no research on superposition in network graphs,
the idea that a system can simultaneously be in multiple nodes at once.

### Game Trees

While tic-tac-toe can be mapped effectively onto a game tree[^79], chess
cannot; there are typically multiple ways to reach a given board
position. The full generality of a directed network graph is more
appropriate, it's just easier to demonstrate the difference between a
classical traversal and a quantum traversal on a tree structure. They
can be converted into each other; the game tree will have nodes that are
duplicates of each other but with only one entry into each node, while
the directed graph will have unique nodes with multiple entries. What
weighted superpositions do is abstract the number of entries into a
single number.

Consider a 2D chess game where both royal pawns have been advanced to
their respective 4^th^ ranks. Did each pawn make a double advance, or
did some of them make two single advances? This cannot be determined
from the state of the board; data outside the system is required, such
as the listing of moves. From the state of the board, one does not know
in what order the royal pawns were advanced, one does not know if the
advances were single or double, thus one does not know how many moves
have occurred, nor even whose turn it is. The past, as deducible from
the current state, is surprisingly ambiguous.

### Oscillating Rook

Here is a devious example; a rook which advances and then retreats,
several times between the same two tiles. Can you tell from the state of
the board how many times this has occurred? Not in classical chess.[^80]

Figure 260 shows a series of snapshots of a rook, initially classical,
which does just this; advancing and retreating between two tiles
multiple times in a pure quadrant[]{.indexref
entry="pure quadrant:Quadrant move which does not include the end tiles."}
move to perimeter 2. The superpositions beautifully preserve the history
of this oscillation; no external data required. There is ambiguity about
where it is located, but not about its past.

![[]{#_Ref84928667 .anchor}Figure 260: Oscillating Quantum
Rook](media/image261.png){alt="A close-up of a computer screen Description automatically generated with low confidence"
width="6.45in" height="5.96in"}

Four snapshots of an initially classical rook (ghost piece) which
advances and retreats a fixed distance in a fixed direction; an
oscillating rook. The probability packet is nearly symmetric on odd
moves (a) & (c) and fully symmetric on even moves (b) & (d). If the
spread is fixed, the distance and direction of the oscillating moves can
be determined, as can the forward and reverse relative perimeters. Note
that the number of oscillations is particularly easy to extract from the
state. While the edges of the board will eventually distort the packet,
until then or on very large boards, the history of the rook's moves is
preserved in the superposition.

Now imagine that it gets 'measured', reduced to a classical piece in
just one tile. There is no longer any ambiguity about its location, but
there is now ambiguity about its past.

Speculations about reducing the ambiguity of the present by shifting it
into the past will be left to the wiles of the Intrepid Reader.[^81]

### Weighted Superpositions versus Unique Histories

To reiterate; a virtual piece represents a unique history, but when two
or more are on the same tile they represent the same state, just arrived
at in different ways. The number of virtual pieces on a tile is the
*weight* assigned to that state. The problem with unique histories is
that they require exponential amounts of information to represent them.
Weighted superpositions, on the other hand, do not. There are only a
finite number of tiles on the board (states), and with positional
notation (standard 10-digit numbers, or even bits) exponential sized
numbers can be represented with only a linear number of symbols. The
state of the board after move three in the previous figure would be
represented like this.

$\Psi_{R} = \frac{1}{27}\left\{ \begin{matrix}
{\mathbf{1}|\left. \ KR5,6 \right\rangle}_{R}\bigoplus \\
{\mathbf{5}|\left. \ KR5,5 \right\rangle}_{R}\bigoplus \\
{\mathbf{1}|\left. \ KR6,5 \right\rangle}_{R}\bigoplus
\end{matrix}\begin{matrix}
{\ \mathbf{2}|\left. \ KR4,6 \right\rangle}_{R}\bigoplus \\
{\ \mathbf{5}|\left. \ KR4,5 \right\rangle}_{R}\bigoplus \\
{\ \mathbf{2}|\left. \ KR6,4 \right\rangle}_{R}\bigoplus
\end{matrix}\begin{matrix}
{\ \mathbf{1}|\left. \ KR3,6 \right\rangle}_{R}\bigoplus \\
{\ \mathbf{5}|\left. \ KR5,5 \right\rangle}_{R}\bigoplus \\
{\ \mathbf{1}|\left. \ KR6,3 \right\rangle}_{R}\bigoplus
\end{matrix}\begin{matrix}
{\ \mathbf{1}|\left. \ KR3,5 \right\rangle}_{R}\bigoplus \\
{\ \mathbf{2}|\left. \ KR4,4 \right\rangle}_{R}\bigoplus \\
{\ \mathbf{1}|\left. \ KR5,3 \right\rangle}_{R}\ \ \ \ 
\end{matrix} \right\}$ (11)

The weights are in bold for clarity (1, 2, & 5 in this example). Note
that they sum to 27, the inverse of the normalization constant. While
the number of terms in this expression increases with each move, it is
capped at 64 for one level, and the weights can represent exponential
sized numbers with only a linear number of digits.

This point bears emphasis; if the game requires exponential amounts of
information to play, not for *strategic play* (what makes classical
chess a worthwhile challenge), but for *practical play*, just to figure
out if a move is even *legal*, then the game is *unplayable* by Turing
machines, which, presumably, includes humans. Weighted superposition and
separability are tools to combat this growth. Are they sufficient; and
if not, does that imply that quantum 3D chess is not viable?

### The Quest for an Objective Measurement Mechanism

We've seen pruning by conflict and pruning by differentiation, but we
haven't yet come across a situation that feels like a measurement. Is it
possible to construct a quantum state which requires an objective
measurement mechanism in quantum 3D chess; one where it becomes
necessary for a new type of move to be made?

In Quantum tic-tac-toe, this turned out to be easy. Every regular move
consisted of placing two spooky marks (virtual pieces) in different
squares. This placed every move into a simple two-way superposition.
Classical moves were not allowed; no focused superpositions.

Eventually a cyclic entanglement occurred. Unresolved, this would have
allowed the quantum game rules to be violated in two ways. First, if
both spooky marks were placed in squares that were a part of the cyclic
entanglement, then every reality in the classical ensemble[]{.indexref
entry="classical ensemble:classical ensemble"} became illegal. This
broke the game. One would have something like 4 moves trying to fit into
just 3 squares. Second, if just one of the spooky marks were placed in
the cyclic entanglement, then the only legal games left forced that move
to be in the square containing the other spooky mark; in essence, a
classical move. Once there was a single cyclic entanglement, every
player could place one spooky mark in the cycle reducing the other
spooky mark to a classical mark. The game lost its quantum nature and
degenerated into a classical game. This broke the quantum nature of the
game.

To balance the game strategically, the player who did not make the move
which created the cyclic entanglement was required to *choose* which of
two possible collapses would be kept and which pruned. Then they made
their regularly scheduled move.

What is anticipated therefore, is some situation in quantum 3D chess
that *breaks the game*.

Consider a situation where the classical ensemble[]{.indexref
entry="ensemble:A collection of classical games which imply a quantum game."}
consists of just two histories. Now consider a superposition move that
is illegal if *both* realities exist, but which is legal only if
*either* one is the *only* reality that exists. Attempting this move
requires that one of the possible realities must be pruned out of the
classical ensemble[]{.indexref
entry="ensemble:A collection of classical games which imply a quantum game."},
but it is not pruned by contradiction or differentiation; it must be
pruned by *choice*. One of the players must make a *new type* of move, a
*collapse* move.

It is unclear at this juncture if such situations are possible.

### What is a Measurement?

The game tree metaphor allows a unique discussion about the meaning of
the term *measurement*. Given a set of rules and an initial state, all
possible evolutions of a system are captured by the game tree (network).
Does this not completely characterize the system? What else is there to
say?

A lot.

In a classical game, an instance of the game is one unique path through
the game tree. In a quantum game, superposition selects a handful of
paths, which subsequently get whittled down. In quantum tic-tac-toe,
just two paths were selected with each move (the pair of spooky marks),
in quantum 3D chess, it is just the paths associated with the tiles on a
single perimeter. Variations might also allow additional superpositions;
distance (multiple perimeters), or of direction (quadrants), or
manifolds (planes), or even of different pieces.

Regardless of the superpositions, the evolution of quantum games also
leads to a whittling of the active paths in a game tree. In this work,
the term *pruned* has been used; a path is terminated. Termination might
be due to conflict, or differentiation (both of which we have already
seen) or because of a *formal measurement*; a situation where a new type
of move must be invoked, one which we have not yet seen, but which we
expect, or maybe just hope, exists.

Viewed from the perspective of this spectrum, a classical game is just
an extreme form of a measurement, where the player has complete control
of the 'pruning.' In a quantum game, the game 'yearns to be free' to
exist across the entire game tree; it fights the player. What we seek is
some kind of pruning that captures what is recognizable as an analog of
a *quantum measurement*.

### Ambiguous State Representation

One of the great lures of a quest is the tension between what one
expects to find, and what one actually finds.[^82] Given a set of rules
which govern a system's evolution, the state of the system is all that
is required to specify the future. In classical physics, this
specification is deterministic, in quantum physics, it is statistical.
In games, the future is represented by the forward game tree from the
current node (classical) or nodes (quantum); the past is represented by
a single path for classical game, multiple paths for a quantum game. In
classical games, state specification is achieved by the *locations of
the pieces* on the board. Does this hold for quantum games? Do the
*locations of the virtual pieces* specify the state of the board?

Figure 261 shows a situation where White uses her pawn and rook to
capture Black's knight and bishop. The knight and bishop each start in a
2-way superposition, and the pawn and rook each end up in a 2-way
superposition (a). The pawn captured the knight, in one of two
positions, and the rook captured the bishop, in one of two positions.
Both beginning and ending states are separable (b).

![[]{#_Ref83803851 .anchor}Figure 261: State of the Board After a
Quantum Capture --
Separable.](media/image262.png){alt="A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated with medium confidence"
width="6.5in" height="3.7416666666666667in"}

The Black knight and bishop are both in 2-way superpositions. White's
pawn can capture the knight (green decorators), ending up in a 2-way
superposition, and White's rook can capture the bishop (red decorators),
ending up in a 2-way superposition (a). The product state is separable
(b).

After the capture, the pawn and the rook are each in 2-way
superpositions.

$\Psi_{P} = \frac{1}{2}\left\{ {|\left. \ KN2,3 \right\rangle}_{P}\ \bigoplus\ {|\left. \ KN3,4 \right\rangle}_{P} \right\}$
(12)

$\Psi_{R} = \frac{1}{2}\left\{ {|\left. \ KB5,5 \right\rangle}_{R}\ \bigoplus\ {|\left. \ KB6,4 \right\rangle}_{R} \right\}$
(13)

Here is the product state, where either piece may be in either tile,
independently of the other.

$\Psi_{PR} = \frac{1}{4}\left\{ \begin{array}{r}
{|\left. \ KN2,3 \right\rangle}_{P}{|\left. \ KB5,5 \right\rangle}_{R}\ \bigoplus\ {|\left. \ KN3,4 \right\rangle}_{P}{|\left. \ KB5,5 \right\rangle}_{R}\bigoplus \\
{|\left. \ KN2,3 \right\rangle}_{P}{|\left. \ KB6,4 \right\rangle}_{R}\ \bigoplus\ {|\left. \ KN3,4 \right\rangle}_{P}{|\left. \ KB6,4 \right\rangle}_{R}\ \ \ \ 
\end{array} \right\}$ (14)

There are 4 realities in the classical ensemble[]{.indexref
entry="classical ensemble:classical ensemble"}.

Figure 262 shows a variation of the above scenario where a virtual
knight and bishop have been exchanged. White can still capture Black's
knight and bishop, the knight and bishop still start in 2-way
superpositions, and the pawn and rook each end up in a 2-way
superposition (a). However, the pawn captured *either* the knight or the
bishop, and the rook captured *either* the bishop or the knight, but
obviously, they couldn't both capture the same piece. Both pawn and rook
have two possible final states, but those states are no longer
separable.

![[]{#_Ref83803867 .anchor}Figure 262: State of the Board After a
Quantum Capture -
Entangled](media/image263.png){alt="A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated with medium confidence"
width="6.5in" height="3.7416666666666667in"}

Here the Black knight and bishop are in different 2-way superpositions.
White's pawn can capture either the knight or the bishop, and White's
rook can capture either the bishop or the knight, both ending up in a
2-way superposition (a). The product state is entangled (b), but that
can't be determined by the positions of the virtual pieces. The board
state is ambiguous.

Unfortunately, simply placing a pair of virtual pawns and a pair of
virtual rooks on the board, fails to capture this restriction (b). The
resulting representation of the state, (virtual pieces on the board), is
ambiguous. Figure 261 (b) and Figure 262 (b) are identical; and thus,
ambiguous.

After the capture, the pawn and the rook are again each in 2-way
superpositions.

$\Psi_{P} = \frac{1}{2}\left\{ {|\left. \ KN2,3 \right\rangle}_{P}\ \bigoplus\ {|\left. \ KN3,4 \right\rangle}_{P} \right\}$
(15)

$\Psi_{R} = \frac{1}{2}\left\{ {|\left. \ KB5,5 \right\rangle}_{R}\ \bigoplus\ {|\left. \ KB6,4 \right\rangle}_{R} \right\}$
(16)

But the product state is entangled; either piece may be in either tile,
but not independently.

$\Psi_{PR} = \frac{1}{2}\left\{ \begin{array}{r}
{|\left. \ KN2,3 \right\rangle}_{P}{|\left. \ KB5,5 \right\rangle}_{R}\ \bigoplus\ {|\left. \ KN3,4 \right\rangle}_{P}{|\left. \ KB5,5 \right\rangle}_{R}\bigoplus \\
{|\left. \ KN2,3 \right\rangle}_{P}{|\left. \ KB6,4 \right\rangle}_{R}\ \bigoplus\ {|\left. \ KN3,4 \right\rangle}_{P}{|\left. \ KB6,4 \right\rangle}_{R}\ \ \ \ 
\end{array} \right\}$ (17)

Now there are only 2 realities in the ensemble[]{.indexref
entry="ensemble:Short for classical ensemble."}. This is like the
earlier example of a pure EPR entanglement, but those could be
represented on the board with virtual pieces; sharing tiles makes the
entanglement clear. Here they don't share a tile, but the either-or
relationship still exists. We'll call them pseudo EPR states but
stipulate ignorance if such states are possible in physical quantum
systems.

Figure 263 shows how the final states of the pawn and rook are
correlated -- it requires *two* 3D quantum boards (b) and (c). Despite
the swarm and any rules, these kinds of entanglements threaten to
require exponential amounts of information to convey the true state of
the game.

![[]{#_Ref83803941 .anchor}Figure 263: Virtual Pieces Cannot Represent
Unambiguous
State](media/image264.png){alt="Shape Description automatically generated with low confidence"
width="6.5in" height="5.695833333333334in"}

Either the pawn captured the knight and the rook captured the bishop
(b), or the pawn captured the bishop and the rook captured the knight
(c). It's going to take *two* 3D quantum boards to represent the state
of the game unambiguously.

This is terrifying. The fixed and finite number of states on the 3D
chess board placed a limit on the amount of information required to
represent the state of the board. In particular, it limited the growth
short of exponential. Here is a case where two boards are required to
represent the state; instead of being limited to 512 states, now the
game is requiring 1024. Every later move that results in a pseudo EPR
entanglement will split them, and again, and again, and again, doubling
the number of quantum boards each time. We are confronted with
exponential growth.

If it requires exponential amounts of information to represent the state
of the game, then determining whether a proposed move is even legal also
scales exponentially; and that breaks the game. Suddenly, it seems like
quantum 3D chess is not viable after all.

### Fixup Rules

In the game industry, the best games are constructed from a few simple
primitives that lead to complex and interesting play. What is
surprising, is that these otherwise beautiful games are often able to
achieve situations that mare that perfection. In Go, there is a
situation called Ko; where intransigent players can perpetuate play ad
infinitum. Ko breaks the game. Therefore, a special *fixup rule* is
added; board positions may not immediately repeat. In chess, 50 moves
without a capture ends the game in a stalemate, less the game also
continue indefinitely. Another beautiful game broken, another *fixup
rule*.

In quantum tic-tac-toe (QT3), failure to collapse a cyclic entanglement
allows moves which break the game. The solution is another *fixup rule*,
a collapse rule -- an objective measurement mechanism. That solution is
not utilized in quantum 3D chess because such entanglements do not
collapse in physical systems, so collapsing them is not a good analog.
It was suitable in QT3 because of its low resolution and suggestive
implication of achieving nonlinearity by self-reference. Quantum 3D
chess is also intended to serve as an abstract system from which to
study the classical/quantum connection. Given its greater resolution,
something more suitable is desired.

We've just seen, that pseudo EPR states (and their more complex
cousins), because of the non-computability of their exponential growth,
break quantum 3D chess. But this is exactly what we were looking for. A
few pages back it was baldly stated that what was sought, in fact, was a
situation that *broke the game*. We just need a *fixup rule*. As long as
the quantum state of the game can be represented by virtual pieces on a
*single* 3D chess board, the pieces can be as entangled as they like,
the superpositions as large as they like, the situation as complex as
they like; no problem, only a polynomial amount of information is
required. But once this can no longer be achieved, once it requires
*more than one* boards, the gig is up. A new type of move is required;
someone must choose which board play will continue on -- someone must
make a *collapse move*. The game collapses to one state, a quantum state
in general, since only the pseudo EPR pieces that split the game go
classical, but it is a state which can be represented by the locations
of virtual pieces on a single 3D board.

One of the players will have to be tasked with choosing upon which board
further play will commence. There are a number of options here, and it
is possibly premature to set a rule in concrete; but for the moment,
let's specify that the player that caused the problem is the one tasked
with resolving it. Call this the *karma rule*.

We have an objective measurement mechanism.

### The Many World's[]{.indexref entry="Many Worldâs:Multiple quantum games, the scatter rule prohibits interference."} Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics

One can of course attempt to continue to play past this point. There are
two options; continue to enforce the swarm and any rule on both boards
-- or not. In the latter case, the scatter rule applies *between* the
pair of boards; each board develops separately from then on. They each
have an independent ensemble[]{.indexref
entry="ensemble:Short for classical ensemble."} of classical games, and
neither board has any influence any more on the other. They have split
apart into two separate games, two separate quantum games, two separate
worlds if you will.

What a great analog with the Many Worlds' interpretation of quantum
mechanics.

Figure 264 shows a tantalizing abstraction of this.

![[]{#_Ref85194339 .anchor}Figure 264: Collapse and/or Many
Worlds](media/image265.png){alt="Background pattern Description automatically generated"
width="6.5in" height="4.074305555555555in"}

When the quantum state cannot be represented on a single board, the
universe splits and one player must choose upon which board play
continues. The classical White rook and pawn are the only differences
between these two worlds; they are in the pseudo EPR positions from the
previous figure. The quantum states reveal much about the history. The
Black king castled king side, the White king made a royal castle with
the queen rook. Black's queen rook made a linear quantum move up the
vertical column with asymmetric spread and his queen knight attempted a
rook move. White's queen pawn made a double advance, her queen knight
pawn two single advances, and her king rook pawn made a double advance
followed by a single advance that was pruned by conflict. White gets to
choose the collapse; she should probably choose world #2.

If play continues on both boards with the scatter rule between them, but
with the swarm rule in effect on each, then the players are now playing
some kind of *meta chess*.[^83]

### The Humility of Research

The Intrepid Reader may have noticed that in the example of an
entanglement requiring multiple boards (Figure 263), that an ambiguous
state was hit when either the pawn or the rook made the first capture.
However, since capture involves sharing tiles, it is likely that a
suitable capture notation is feasible that delays the need for multiple
boards, but this possibility has not been explored.

At the time of this writing, our understanding of quantum 3D chess is
quite limited. There may well exist additional collapse mechanisms,
perhaps a better one. It may turn out that the exponential growth
quickly tops out. It may be that the pseudo EPR entanglements have good
analogs in physics, and that such systems do not in fact collapse,
weakening this version's suitability as an abstract quantum system. With
good software support, there are certainly discoveries to be made that
will surprise & delight and allow yet deeper investigations into the
strange embrace between classical and quantum systems. The manual
exploration attempted here has surely only uncovered the tip of the
iceberg, and what a tip it has turned out to be!

But as the final chapter in a book, supposedly about classical 3D chess,
this is good enough for now. It makes a great capstone for the quest.
And perhaps a worthy challenge for further research.

### Review

This approach to quantum 3D chess lets pieces *move to the perimeter*
resulting in *superposition* rather than being restricted to a *single
tile*. It honors a different *invariant* than classical 3D chess; the
number of choices to select a move is *capped at four*, rather than as
many as needed to reduce selection to a *single tile*.

A piece in superposition is indicated by a set of *virtual pieces*,
half-size mini versions of the classical piece. The *swarm rule* implies
that these are not individual pieces; they are an accounting technique.
Moves are specified by selecting an *anchor piece* and a *proxy tile*;
each virtual piece therefore makes the same *relative move*. Each
virtual piece represents a *unique history* of classical moves. When
they share a tile, the implication is that there were multiple ways to
get the piece to that tile.

The number of virtual pieces on a given tile imply a *weight*, how
likely that *state* is. Unlike in quantum mechanics superposition
weights are real, *integral* actually, rather than complex. Since moves
are chosen by the players, not by chance, there are no probabilities,
but if there were, they would be *direct*, rather than having to square
the complex weights (complex conjugate).

A quantum game implies a set of simultaneous classical games, the
*classical ensemble*[]{.indexref
entry="classical ensemble:classical ensemble"}. Each piece exists
*across* this ensemble[]{.indexref
entry="ensemble:Short for classical ensemble."}; its set of virtual
pieces *is* the piece. The classical ensemble[]{.indexref
entry="classical ensemble:classical ensemble"} is not the
[]{#many_worlds .anchor}*Many World's*[]{.indexref
entry="Many Worldâs:Multiple quantum games, the scatter rule prohibits interference."}
interpretation of quantum mechanics; call it []{#plural_realities
.anchor}*Plural Realities*[]{.indexref
entry="Plural Realities:Multiple classical games, the swarm rule allows for interference."}.

The *swarm rule* was chosen over the *scatter rule*, for the latter led
to exponential amounts of information just to list the moves. The swarm
rule specifies that every virtual piece makes the same *relative move*.
It led to the first analog with quantum physics, the *pawn propagating
probability packet*.

The canonical discovery principle for determining a proper rule set was
the *self-consistency criterion*; any reality in the classical
ensemble[]{.indexref entry="classical ensemble:classical ensemble"}
should represent a valid classical game of 3D chess.

To avoid deadlock in the quantum version, the *any rule* was chosen over
the *all rule*; a proposed move was legal if *at least one* classical
game in the ensemble[]{.indexref
entry="ensemble:Short for classical ensemble."} was legal. This meant
that a move which resulted in one or move illegal games, was allowed by
simply deleting all the illegal games from the classical
ensemble[]{.indexref entry="classical ensemble:classical ensemble"};
*pruning by conflict*. This led to a partial analog with diffraction, a
clear *probability shadow*, but no interference effects.

The fact that different virtual pieces could be subject to different
move rules, such as pawn promotion or unshackling (or stack fission,
etc.), lead to another way to deplete the classical ensemble[]{.indexref
entry="classical ensemble:classical ensemble"}; *pruning by
differentiation*.

Ambiguities around quadrant versus linear moves and what to do about end
tiles were all resolved with one technique: *focused superposition*.
This resulted in a clean move notation which permitted some control over
the extent of the resulting superposition. While not strictly compliant
with the discovery principle, it was better suited to using the rule set
for theoretical explorations, the pure game being regarded as too
difficult to play anyway.

A rule of superposition was 'invented' for the knight.[^84]

The stack however delivered the long-promised explanation for the
restriction of the classical fission rule. In quantum fission, the
bishop and duke perimeters had to share an overlap tile; this implied
that the classic pure stack move was a *failed fission*. This provided a
delightful paradigm example of a more advanced abstraction shedding
light on an earlier one.

Superposition rules for queen, king & pawn were left in the capable
hands of the Intrepid Reader.

The jargon of a*ctive piece*, the one in motion, and any it interacted
with, a *fixed piece*, was introduced. A variety of ways to *tag*
virtual pieces for additional clarity and ways to indicate large
superpositions *numerically* were also introduced.

A modified Dirac notation was introduced to clarify the mathematical
distinction between *separable* and *entangled* states introducing
*semi-entangled states* and *EPR states*. These came in two varieties;
*pure* which had virtual pieces sharing tiles, and *pseudo* where they
did not. The scientific credentials of this distinction were not
explored.

The network graph model of games was introduced suggesting that
classical games consisted of a *single path* down the classical game
tree while a quantum game consisted of *multiple paths* down the same
game tree.

Speculations about indeterminacy being *shuffled* between past, present,
and future were highlighted with the example of an *oscillating rook*.

The distinction between history and state was covered, and the
*importance of state* to the evolution of systems, both physical and
games. *Duplicated states* led directly to *weighted superpositions*.
The not so hidden agenda of finding an objective measurement mechanism
was revealed.

In a counter-intuitive development, it was discovered that simply
placing virtual pieces on the 3D chess board was *insufficient* to
represent the state of the quantum game. Entanglements arising because
virtual pieces *shared tiles* were fine, but others yielded EPR style
entanglements whose virtual piece layout was identical to other quantum
games where the states were separable. Virtual pieces alone turned out
to be insufficient to avoid *ambiguous state* representations.

Representing such ambiguous states required *multiple quantum boards.*
The threat of this defect was the specter of *exponential growth* which
would have made the game *unplayable* -- it *broke* the game. It was
noted that game breaking situations are common and typically
accommodated by the addition of a *fixup rule.* In this case, the fixup
rule was to invoke a *collapse rule*; the player who created the
situation was responsible for *choosing* one quantum board on which play
would continue.

This provided an *objective measurement mechanism* and a great analog of
the *Many Worlds' interpretation* of quantum mechanics. Each quantum
board was now free to be explored separately. While the virtual pieces
on each board were still subject to the *swarm rule*, between the
boards, the *scatter rule* was in effect. Neither board had any effect
on the other; without invoking collapse, the players would now be
playing two games of quantum 3D chess -- some weird kind of *meta
chess*.

If collapse is not performed here, then both quantum boards remain under
the *swarm rule*. There is the potential for this alternative to lead to
an even better measurement mechanism, but such a research effort is
beyond the scope of this book.

The collapse rule identified here meets the criteria for an objective
measurement mechanism, but I can't help but wonder how far these
abstractions might have to be taken before a breakthrough insight is
achieved that can truly resolve the quantum measurement problem in
physics proper.

Therefore, before we go, just one more thing...[^85]

### Temporal Quantum 3D Chess

Let's consider one more abstraction; pieces are not moved; they are
*placed into motion*. On every *tick* of White's moves and on every
*tock* of Black's move all of each player's pieces in motion advance one
perimeter, stopping only when the next perimeter is illegal.

All this *temporal quantum 3D chess*.[^86]

This really shows off the bosonic nature of advancement squares, but it
also explains why a specification for stack fusion in classical 3D chess
was left unresolved. The bishop/duke overlap tiles are on *different
perimeters*; 2N for the bishop & 1N for the duke on q-tiles, and 2N for
the bishop & 3N for the duke on Feynman tiles. To have a real fusion
move requires the two sub-pieces to be placed in motion at *different
times*. There is no way to do that in either the classical or the
quantum game, but it could be done in a temporal version.

But temporal moves also offer another new game phenomenon; they lead to
*race conditions*.

Two advancing pieces may arrive at the same time, say, to capture an
opponent piece. Only one may do so, the other had to stop advancing at
the previous perimeter. There is no consistent way to resolve this with
rules, so one of the players must be tasked with making a new type of
move, a new type of player choice is required; perhaps another example
of a collapse move. Maybe, but temporal moves are not inherently
quantum; they can be implemented in classical chess as well. Sigh.

Perhaps there is more than one measurement mechanism. If so, this fact
alone might explain why it has been such a hard problem.

### Limits

It seems that it is the fate of all research to ultimately confront
limits. Perhaps this is a good thing. How sad would it be if there were
no more questions to pursue? Achieving a Theory of Everything could turn
out to be a pyric victory. To quote one more fictional character...

"In time you may find that having is not nearly so desirable a thing as
wanting. It is not logical, but it is often true."[^87]

# Epilogue

There is a reason most games are invented rather than discovered; the
flexibility of invention allows them to be crafted for playability.
Discovery is more dogmatic and thus more ridged. 3D chess with planar
moves and advancement squares is less intuitive than other variants, we
are just not used to games which violate the trajectory paradigm.
However, a good software implementation of the game can go a long way in
building our non-trajectory intuition. For better or worse, it was the
strict adherence to the discovery[]{.indexref
entry="discovery:Rules to 3D chess must be discovered, not invented."}
principle which led here, and to no place simpler or more accessible.

So then, what should we do with this game?

### Whither 3D Chess?

Classic chess offers multiple benefits; it teaches the importance of
tactics and strategy, of the rewards of study and discipline, the
importance of planning and the adaptability to unforeseen obstacles or
aggression. It teaches humility in victory, and grace in defeat. It
offers hope that our destiny lies in our choices rather than in fate,
and it binds us together as social creatures. It is one of the finest
examples of what games can offer in improving the human condition.[^88]

3D chess offers a handful of benefits above and beyond flat chess[^89].

First of course is the challenge and importance of paradigms; it is such
an excellent example of how to break through a paradigm barrier. It is
great training in the art of questioning hidden assumptions. Life is
fraught with challenges, perhaps a few even rise to the level of being
existential.[^90] Thinking out of the box has survival value, but it
also makes life more interesting. Getting better at it is a win for
individuals and for society.

Second, it offers a new challenge to the AI community, a much harder
game in which to test, perfect, and quantify new algorithms for AI. It
would be interesting to see if a human is ever a 3D chess world
champion, or if that title will always lay comfortably in the land of
the machines.

There are those who believe that AI is an existential threat to our
survival as a species; their concerns should be given due consideration.
However, teaching a machine to play a game, is still a far cry from
general purpose intelligence. I won't be concerned until an AI can be
programmed to breakthrough a paradigm barrier; show me an AI that given
tic-tac-toe can invent (discover[]{.indexref
entry="discover:A piece which when moved unblocks an attack from another piece."}?)
the rules for Four-ScoreÂ® (vertical 4x4 tic-tac-toe), or QubicÂ® (3D
tic-tac-toe, 4x4x4), or quantum tic-tac-toe (spooky marks), or extend
any classical game into some non-obvious higher abstraction. Show me
that software, show me a computer that can pass that kind of Turing
Test, call it a *Paradigm Test*, and then we can fret about our
extinction as a species at the hand of our own silicon creations. Until
then, my bet is on humans.

Third, it provides a rich new source of chess puzzles[]{.indexref
entry="chess puzzles:Limited objective practice situations which stress chess principles"}.
While a whole game of 3D chess is daunting, and potentially exhausting,
a two or three move 3D chess puzzle can be almost as rich as an entire
2D game. In this case, 'play' is more asymmetrical; there are the puzzle
builders, and the puzzle solvers. Mastery of chess puzzles[]{.indexref
entry="chess puzzles:Limited objective practice situations which stress chess principles"}
is likely a critical tool for those who accept the challenge of gaining
proficiency in the 3D game. They certainly played that role in 2D chess.

Fourth, the complexity of 3D chess makes it very difficult to see
multiple moves ahead, too much brain power must be exerted just to
confirm a move's legality, much less explore a gambit[]{.indexref
entry="gambit:Standard sequence of moves with a well establish purpose or outcome."}
space more than one or two moves ahead. With a typical branching ratio
in excess of 100, seeing even three to four moves ahead becomes
problematic for unaugmented humans. Thus, I propose we use 3D chess as a
testbed for developing augmentation technology. Instead of Artificial
Intelligence (AI), let's invert that, and shoot for Intelligence
Amplification (IA). The vision here is of a computer interface that is
so seamlessly integrated with the user, that one can in fact 'see' four,
five, six moves ahead.

The software to do this will require at least two major elements; a
presentation layer that can rapidly present the advancement manifolds of
a gambit[]{.indexref
entry="gambit:Standard sequence of moves with a well establish purpose or outcome."},
and a user interface that allows a player to direct[]{.indexref
entry="direct:Linear moves with two virtual quadrants reduce to a single end tile."}
the exploration of that gambit[]{.indexref
entry="gambit:Standard sequence of moves with a well establish purpose or outcome."}
with great rapidity. Mouse and keyboard may not suffice. This might
require an eye tracking interface so the software can assess what the
player is looking at, a glove that allows for input in 3D, a virtual
reality headset that provides a 3D view, etc. The goal is not to produce
a program that can play the game well, but one that can help a human
play very well, well enough to beat an AI.

It's not clear at this point where the dividing line falls between help
and kibitzing, but that can be figured out as the technology matures. It
could help level the playing field between a human and an AI or just
make playing against another person more rewarding. As a testbed, the
technologies developed could find applications in diverse fields, ones
that would more directly extend human mastery over our environment.

Fifth, as a formal system[]{.indexref
entry="formal system:A perfectly isolated system (mathematical); a mini universe."},
the quantum version offers a rich platform to explore the perplexing
connection between classical and quantum systems. I don't believe that
4D chess presents another paradigm barrier (I could be very mistaken
here) and the complexity is extremely daunting, but I would relish the
opportunity to explore quantum 3D chess more deeply. It showed up so
effortlessly.

In the very first chapter, the 3D chess board prop for Star Trek was
discussed, and it was noted in passing, that it is actually an early
version of []{#space_chess .anchor}*space chess*[]{.indexref
entry="space chess:Chess variations where parts of the board can be moved."},
a variation where the board itself can be moved around (those four 2x2
side boards can actually be moved, how cool!). I would love to see a
classical game of space 'something' where moves consisted of changing
spacetime; a game designed on the principles of relativity. Then, look
for the rule changes that yield a quantum version. Perhaps hiding in
that transition are clues to the problem of quantum gravity, a deep
problem in physics that has thwarted our best efforts and brightest
minds.

It has taken way too long to defeat the trajectory[]{.indexref
entry="trajectory:A unique path (a sequence of tiles) from one tile to another."}
paradigm. The classical paradigm of fixed space and fixed time is going
to be even tougher. I'm all in.

### Fin

Well, it's been quite a ride. The road took us a bit farther than
anticipated, yet the whole trip began with an audacious rejection of the
obvious, "Objects move from here to there in mathematically precise,
one-dimensional paths." Surely, they must move along *trajectories* --
apparently not. Not in 3D chess, not in quantum physics. Our
survival-of-the-fittest, common-sense, logical-linear-western-thought
algorithms hid the solutions to both for a very long time. Ouch.

Is God laughing at our foibles or shaking His head at our daftness?
Perhaps, if He did indeed create this reality, perhaps He is smiling; at
long last constructs have emerged capable, bit by bit, of perceiving
reality as their Creator sees it. A 13-billion-year quest. Now there is
a definition of glory to satisfy the most strident theologian.[^91]

A certain amount of humility suddenly seems warranted. The vehicle of
invention, powerful as it is, was unable to surmount such difficulties.
Our inventiveness is riddled with classical assumptions. Despite
staggering mathematical success, we still struggle to conceptualize
quantum nature. It's unnatural. Well, unnatural to us at any rate. For
us, it requires the ardor of a quest, a discovery quest, to peel back
even one more layer between reality and understanding -- be it chess or
physics.

Discovery is ascendant over invention.

# Appendix II -- Tables of Tile Decorators

This appendix summarizes in one place the decorators used to indicate
advancement squares. A consistent set of memes complement piece specific
color. These memes consist of a small set of diamond shapes. Decorator
color generally referrers to the type of piece with red, green, & blue
tied to the base pieces, rook, bishop, & duke[]{.indexref
entry="duke:The third base piece, moves along vertex rays."}
respectively. The decorations indicate special properties of the
tile[]{.indexref
entry="tile:Generic term for the unit cell; square in 2D, cube in 3D."}
such as *end*, *linear*, *apex* etc.

The decorators are grouped into categories. Between the piece colors and
the categories, the amount of information to be mastered is a lot less
than it first appears. In the body of the book only a few decorators are
introduced at a time in order to flatten the learning curve. The tables
here are intended for review; the entire set can be seen in three pages
-- forest versus trees. Knight is in yellow, king and queen have a
purple border to their decorators, the stack has an orange border. Pawn
decorators lack a sharp edge and are slightly smaller.

The following list summarizes the memes.

1.  Source tile -- where the piece is, origin of the advancement
    manifold, large black diamond.

2.  End tiles -- size of black diamond indicates number of planes tile
    can be reached by.

3.  Apex tiles -- one small, outlined diamond, down the diagonal of the
    advancement square; duplex for duke face advance has two small
    outlined diamonds, simplex means one quadrant is blocked, one
    diamond has a thin outline, the other a thick outline.

4.  Linear tiles -- 1 to 3 small black diamonds in a row; number of
    solid diamonds indicate the number of planes a tile can be reached
    by.

5.  Body tile -- solid color, any tile in an advancement manifold,
    particularly one of no particular significance.

6.  Overlap tiles -- the tiles a queen (or stack) can reach as more than
    one base piece; used nested diamonds of the appropriate color.

7.  Generic tiles -- pretty much just king and queen; solid purple.

8.  Lite tile -- for the knight only, other pieces advance, the knight
    jumps, or 'lites' upon a tile.

9.  Pawn bishop attack tiles -- the four ways a pawn may capture like a
    bishop; green with various black (or red) diamonds.

10. Pawn duke attack tiles -- the two ways a pawn may capture like a
    duke; blue with various blue (or red) diamonds.

11. Block tiles -- tiles which when occupied by a piece block advance
    but which cannot be moved to or capture to; characterized by a
    hollow interior diamond.

12. Linear 0 tile -- indicates castling; 2 hollows, king can't move to
    perimeter 1 when castling.

To enhance clarity, these images are scaled up 150% from those used in
the body of the book. Also, the last row in each table tabulates the
number of decorators for that piece or move type.

Table 19 shows the colors assigned to the base pieces and queen, red to
rook, green to bishop and blue to duke. These colors are also used for
the queen but with a purple border.

![[]{#_Ref75339394 .anchor}Table 19: **Decorators for Base Pieces and
Queen**](media/image266.png){alt="Chart Description automatically generated"
width="6.43in" height="5.88in"}

Source tiles have large black diamond. End tiles have a smaller one when
both planes are open, and a small one when only one plane is open. For
the duke moves in three planes the large diamond has a different aspect
ratio. An open diamond indicates an apex tile. Two open diamonds
indicate a duplex move, duke only, and if one has a thin border, then
one plane is blocked. Linear moves are indicated by two solid diamonds.
Each diamond with a thin border indicates a blocked plane. Solid color
decorators without diamonds are body tiles; nothing of specific
interest. The queen has four special decorators for her overlap tiles,
and a solid purple decorator for generic use. Hollow diamonds indicate
final perimeter tiles which may block a move, but to which the piece
cannot move to. Significant tiles are mutual block, apex, and stonewall,
along with duplex tiles for both duke and queen.

Table 20 shows the colors assigned to the knight, stack and pawn.

![[]{#_Ref80109597 .anchor}Table 20: **Decorators for Knight, Stack and
Pawn**](media/image267.png){alt="Chart, table Description automatically generated"
width="6.47in" height="5.88in"}

The knight doesn't advance, so it has only one type of destination tile.
The stack has three move types; as a stack with a thick orange border,
or either of the two decay modes with a thinner orange border; green for
bishop and blue for duke. Same memes for end, apex, duplex, linear and
body tiles apply. However, there are also two overlap tile decorators.
The pawn source tile is a rainbow of base piece colors. The conventional
memes are not used, instead the named capture tiles are used. Those with
multiple colors indicate tiles reachable by both advance and capture.

Table 21 shows the colors assigned to the king and to castling.

![[]{#_Ref80109585 .anchor}Table 21: **Decorators for King and for
Castling**](media/image268.png){alt="Chart, calendar, whiteboard Description automatically generated"
width="6.43in" height="5.88in"}

The conventional memes apply to the king, but like the queen, sport a
purple border. For castling, the same decorators are used as for the
king and rook, but with one addition; when the king makes a double
linear advance on the same level; called a linear0 move.

# Appendix III -- Glossary Tables

## Table of Jargon

A specialized jargon has been developed for 3D chess and used throughout
this book. The table below captures that jargon in one place with
succinct definitions. The terms are presented in the same order in which
they were introduced, making this table an effective review tool. Each
of these is also available in the index in alphabetical order for easy
reference.

Admittedly, this table is a little daunting, the learning curve is
steep, but trying to analyze a chess position without the tool of a good
set of jargon is tedious and trying to communicate such an analysis is
an exercise in frustration. This table is intended as a reference, but
it serves another purpose; by grouping the terms the relationships and
commonalities between them is more apparent, and thus easier to
internalize.

(Note: As of 8/8/2022, Kindle has a limit on the size of tables it can
handle - thus Table 23 has been divided in three; 23A, 23B, 23C.)

## Tables of Chess Invariants

From the rules for 2D chess emerge several invariants; properties which
stay constant while other things change. Invariants offer a powerful way
to think about a system and provide critical tools from which to analyze
a situation. They are invaluable in fields like physics, math and game
theory.

There is short taxonomy to these invariants. There are *fundamental
invariants* which may be degenerate in 2D, which in either case have
consequences; *derivative invariants* that may or may not be preserved
in higher dimensional chess. The *degenerate invariants* are where
choice is involved; they come in pairs. One member of each pair passes
our discovery criteria and leads to play that feels like chess, the
other one does not. Those that fail are *shunned*, those adopted are
*honored*. The first table below lists these.

The *non-degenerate invariants* scale to higher dimensions without
issue. They are listed in the second table below.

The derivative invariants are either *preserved* or *not preserved*.
Those which are not preserved tend to either be inconsequential or
expand the resolution of 3D chess, new behaviors arise that 'fill in'
between behaviors seen in 2D. These new behaviors add a richness to the
tactics and strategy of the game that 'flat' chess cannot hope to match.
They are a rich source for chess puzzles[]{.indexref
entry="chess puzzles:Limited objective practice situations which stress chess principles"}
and make the game that much more fascinating. As a group they suggest
that chess really can be a pan dimensional game.

Gambits which take advantage of them are generally regarded as
*devious*[]{.indexref
entry="devious:Gambits which leverage broken 2D invariants."}.

Many of them are also tightly wedded to the trajectory[]{.indexref
entry="trajectory:A unique path (a sequence of tiles) from one tile to another."}
paradigm. They represent hidden assumptions in our mental models of
reality, not just games of chess, but physical reality as well. Coming
to terms with them is good practice for improving our creative
problem-solving skills.

They are presented in the same order in which they were introduced. Each
of these is also available in the index in alphabetical order for easy

Many of the invariants of 2D chess scale to higher dimensions without
issues. 3D chess preserves all of these.

+---------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| 1.  Piece design    | The shape of a chess piece alludes to how it   |
|                     | moves.                                         |

: []{#_Toc210218574 .anchor}Table 26: **Non-Degenerate Invariants**

The invariants in the two previous tables are fundamental; change them
and the game no longer feels like chess. They have consequences,
however, derivative invariants that we are used to in 2D. It is
instructive to list which of the derivative invariants are preserved
under these rules.

+---------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| 1.  Rook range      | The rook can reach all the tiles on the board. |
+=====================+================================================+
| 2.  Bishop range    | The bishop can reach half the tiles on the     |
|                     | board.                                         |
+---------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| 3.  Duke range      | The duke can reach a quarter of the tiles on   |
|                     | the board.                                     |

: []{#_Toc210218575 .anchor}Table 27: **Derivative Invariants

Likewise, it is instructive to list which derivative invariants are not
preserved under these rules. These are surprises, they violate our
expectations. Some have no impact[]{.indexref
entry="impact:Measures of a pieceâs ability to affect the game; range, PPR, & stab."}
on tactics or strategy, some do.

+---------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| 1.  Black king rook | The Black king rook does not start on a black  |
|                     | tile.                                          |

|     own color       |                                                |
+---------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| 3.  Asymmetrical    | In peeking, one rook may attack another        |
|     like attacks    | without a counterattack.                       |
+---------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| 4.  Symmetrical     | Different base pieces may jointly attack each  |
|     unlike attack   | other.                                         |
+---------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| 5.  Retreat         | A trapdoor prevents a piece from retreating in |
|                     | one move.                                      |

| 6.  Pawns blocking  | Opposing pawns on the same level don't always  |

## Table of Plane Names and Types

Each plane has been given a name and grouped into three major types
according to the type of base piece which moves in that plane. The
bishop and duke planes have also been sub-grouped by pairs.

## Tables of Quadrants

Quadrants are numbered for each base piece type from 1 to 12 or 24 as
appropriate. Numbering transcends planes, but in the order in which they
are presented in Table 29: **Plane Names and Types**. Earliest quadrant
in each plane is either toward the opponent, or toward the top of the
board, or both when possible. Sequencing is clockwise from a
point-of-view, either the White home row (KR) or the neutral perspective
with Black on the left and White on the right. Linear moves are labeled
as the pair of quadrant numbers, in clockwise order for the plane.

## Table of Overlap Tiles

The queen and stack sport overlap tiles; four for the queen, and the
last two of those four for the stack. Technically, the pawn also has
overlap tiles, but since they are split by advance and capture, they are
not normally regarded as such; the dart is a q-tile and the bead is a
brook tile. Since the king only makes linear moves, it doesn't have
overlap tiles either.

: []{#_Toc210218582 .anchor}Table 34: **Overlap Tile Names**

The third named overlap tile allows a four-way attack, and so was
intended to rhyme with 'futile', where the 'Q' suggested both queen and
quark, the name given to multiple piece attacks (it rhymes with fork).
However, a combinate of context and English grammar often makes this
term awkward, so expect to see it with, and without, the hyphen.

Since half the pieces on the board are pawns, these names come in really
handy.

## Table of Castles

Table 36 lists the names of the 36 possible permutations of the basic
five types of castles. Royal castles and double castles are all quadrant
moves for the rook, but perimeter 2 linear moves for the king. Of
necessity, the rook(s) advance in the same plane as the king. For the
vertical castles the question is whether the rook must advance in the
same plane as the king, or not. The permissive rule, that won't have the
computer fighting the players, is to say no, they may move
independently, but it might turn out to be a good balance rule if the
rook must advance in the same plane as the king. The players can choose
to enforce this restriction by mutual agreement.

## Table of Attacks

One of the joys in learning chess was the epiphany that it was possible
to attack pieces in more than one way. What a joy a fork[]{.indexref
entry="fork:Simultaneously attacking two or more pieces with one move."}
is; your opponent cannot block[]{.indexref
entry="block:Blocks cover, prevents a piece from moving to a desired location."}
both attacks -- with one move you threw two punches at them! The
discovered check was even more delightful; what a sneaky move. These
could even be combined; a discovered attack where the moving piece
forked, and potentially forked even more than two pieces.[^92]

In 3D, there are more than just three move types, three times as many in
fact, and the permutations are correspondingly much richer. The table
below summarizes in one place all the possible attacks in 3D chess.

attack.

For 3D, the permutations are even more dramatic. For instance, a moving
piece may discover[]{.indexref
entry="discover:A piece which when moved unblocks an attack from another piece."}
multiple attacks such that three are a quadrant attack, three are a
linear attack, and three a duplex attack, such that each set includes a
peeking[]{.indexref
entry="peeking:A one-way attack because of a third piece on an extant tile."}
attack, a preventable attack, and a degradable attack. That's just the
discovered attacks. If the moving piece also forks, it is possible for
nine forks such that they also exhibit the same three by three
permutations of attacks as the discovered attacks. Add in a couple of
quark[]{.indexref
entry="quark:Refers to an attack that generally requires more than one piece to block."}
attacks and it is likely possible to contrive a situation where a single
move attacks every single one of your opponent's pieces (even after the
stacks have split, 18 pieces) where every attack is of a different
type.[^93]

# About the Author

Allan Goff served as a nuclear officer in the US Air Force for 11 years.
He has taught 50 University classes, presented 18 papers at
international propulsion conferences, and is the author of Quantum
Tic-Tac-Toe. He is married with two children, a founding member of his
home church in Roseville, California, and an avid ballroom dancer. As an
entrepreneur he ran a placement agency for software engineers and won a
two-year contract with the state of California removing 11 megawatts of
demand off the electric grid. His day jobs have included software
engineering and project management gigs in government, business, and
academia.

His great love is the epiphany,[^94] that moment when the mental light
bulb goes off, and some concept finally comes into clear relief.[^95]
