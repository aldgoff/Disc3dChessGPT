# Tactical Analysis (Lesson 12)

Given a state string that defines a position on the board, evaluate it.
- (Board: 8x8x8) (POV-White) [White: K@KB4,4; R@KR1,1] [Black: Q@QB8,8]

## Between pairs of pieces
- What planes.
- What quadrants.
- Linear moves.
- Do this for orthogonal relationships.
- Eventually add perimeters.
- Eventually add forward and reverse advancement manifolds (squares, rectangles).
- Eventually tile types (apex, end, between, overlap clases, specials).
- Eventually do all this for base pieces, then for all the rest.

## Interactions
- Eventually add attacks, defense, blocks, pins, discovereds & forks.
- Eventually torque.

## Positions
- Eventually Starting line up.
- And other interesting positions (peeking, trapdoor, mutual blocks/pins, etc.).

## Board visualizations
- Something like the Inkscape figures of the book.

## Long term objectve
- Lay the foundation for writing the SW to implement the rules and facilitate play.
