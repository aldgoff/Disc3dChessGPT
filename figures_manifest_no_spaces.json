The stack started on Q1,1, with overlap q-tile on Q5,5, which is the only tile with both a virtual duke and a virtual bishop. A stack move is the one classical reality where a quantum fission move failed. There are 5 classical realities for the duke and 21 for the bishop; 105 realities in the classical ensemble. In one of these, the stack failed to fission, S(Q1,1) -- \\[Q5,5\\]~17,17,5~."

      "description": "Four snapshots of an initially classical rook (ghost piece) which advances and retreats a fixed distance in a fixed direction; an oscillating rook. The probability packet is nearly symmetric on odd moves (a) & (c) and fully symmetric on even moves (b) & (d). If the spread is fixed, the distance and direction of the oscillating moves can be determined, as can the forward and reverse relative perimeters. Note that the number of oscillations is particularly easy to extract from the state. While the edges of the board will eventually distort the packet, until then or on very large boards, the history of the rook's moves is preserved in the superposition."

The classical White rook and pawn are the only differences between these two worlds; they are in the pseudo EPR positions from the previous figure. The quantum states reveal much about the history. The Black king castled king side, the White king made a royal castle with the queen rook. Black's queen rook made a linear quantum move up the vertical column with asymmetric spread and his queen knight attempted a rook move. White's queen pawn made a double advance, her queen knight pawn two single advances, and her king rook pawn made a double advance followed by a single advance that was pruned by conflict. White gets to choose the collapse; she should probably choose world #2."
